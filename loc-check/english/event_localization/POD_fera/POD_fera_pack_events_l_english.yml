 POD_fera_pack.2.t: "Spiritual Protection" 
 POD_fera_pack.2.desc: "Among the $glossary_fera$ and especially the Garou, the totem is one of the fundamental binding aspects of the pack. A totem is a potent spirit that lends its power to a group of mystically inclined individuals in exchange for some token service or tribute. The choice of a totem is of extreme importance to a pack, for this spirit will protect them in times of need and serve as a guiding light for the Garou to follow.\nThis choice functions as a petition to the totem spirit, who then decides whether to adopt the pack members as his 'children'."
