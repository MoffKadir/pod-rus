 POD_fera_beastborn.1.t: "Your Furry Friends"
 POD_fera_beastborn.1.bubastivictorious: "Long ago, the Bubasti joined Horus in his eternal fight against his decadent uncle, Set. While the cause was righteous and the Bubasti still take great pride in their contribution, it still resulted in a terrible defeat. The triumphant Setites captured the cat kin of the Bubasti, the Kyphur cats, and either killed them or fed them blood to turn them into aberrant monsters.\nWith their recent victory and daring rescue of the last Kyphur cats however, the Bubasti are now once again prospering and watching over their feline kin, helping them gather strength and heal themselves from the trauma of the long servitude to the Setites."
 POD_fera_beastborn.1.bastet: "Bastet have a strong relationship with their cat-kin. Each tribe carefully watch over their four legged friends and look for the signs of a First Change among them. Cats being very territorial, it also means that the tribes tend to stay put in the region where their kin dwell.\nThose from the cats that end up becoming bastet tend to need more preparation before becoming fully fledged members of the Tribe as the trappings of the human world are new to them. As the local leader, it falls to you to choose how closely you want to monitor and plan for this potential help."
 POD_fera_beastborn.1.werewolf: "Garou have a strong relationship with their wolf-kin. Each tribe, even the most city bound ones like the Warders of Men, carefully watch over their four legged friends and look for the signs of a First Change among them.\nThose from the wolves that end up becoming werewolves tend to need more preparation before becoming fully fledged members of the Tribe as the trappings of the human world are new to them. As the local leader, it falls to you to choose how closely you want to monitor and plan for this potential help."
 POD_fera_beastborn.1.a: "I will nurture my kin."
 start_beastborn_content_tt: "You will be offered options to have [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] $glossary_fera$ of your tribe arrive at your court. This will likely cost you some resources."
 POD_fera_beastborn.1.b: "Perhaps later."
 delayed_start_beastborn_content_tt: "In 30 to 40 years, you will get offered options to have [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] $glossary_fera$ of your tribe arrive at your court. This will cost you prestige, more of it if you are pickier."
 POD_fera_beastborn.1.c: "They will do fine on their own."
 end_beastborn_content_tt: "You won't hear of this again."


 POD_fera_beastborn.2.t: "Lost Kin"
 POD_fera_beastborn.2.desc: "Long ago, the Bubasti joined Horus in his eternal fight against his decadent uncle, Set. While the cause was righteous and the Bubasti still take great pride in their contribution, it still resulted in a terrible defeat. The triumphant Setites captured the cat kin of the Bubasti, the Kyphur cats, and either killed them or fed them blood to turn them into aberrant monsters.\nNowadays, the Bubasti still haven't recovered and, unlike their Bastet sister tribes, don't have access to their feline kinfolk for help and bolstering of numbers.\nThe tribe will likely never truly prosper until the last Kyphur cats are rescued from the Setites."
 POD_fera_beastborn.2.a: "We will save our lost kin."
 bubasti_beastborn_content_tt: "Bubasti have an objective to save their lost cat-kin. They can't benefit from their help until then."




 POD_fera_beastborn.10.t: "Animal Kinship"
 POD_fera_beastborn.10.desc: "You decided to take a proactive approach in monitoring your animal kin your region. You have several trusted allies looking for signs of First Change among them already on site but the area to cover is very large. When an animal experiences the First Change, it tends to be a race between your kind and various ill intentioned hunters so the more people you assign to that surveillance task, the likelier you have to not miss anyone."
 POD_fera_beastborn.10.a: "No kin left behind."
 numerous_beast_born_tooltip: "You will get several [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] courtiers when this event chain ends."
 POD_fera_beastborn.10.b: "I can't cover everyone."
 single_beast_born_tooltip: "You will only get a single [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] courtier when this event chain ends."

 POD_fera_beastborn.11.t: "King Of The Beasts"
 POD_fera_beastborn.11.desc: "Nature is a harsh mistress. Your animal kin, unaware of the struggles of this world, still live and die by its rules. A common argument among $glossary_fera$ is the degree of interference you must take into protecting your kin from the outside world and the predation of men on their natural environment. Some think they should defend them at all costs while others think that these struggles will only result in stronger $glossary_fera$ when the First Change hits them."
 POD_fera_beastborn.11.a: "They will grow strong with the struggle."
 POD_fera_beastborn.11.b: "Their protection is our duty."
 POD_fera_beastborn.11.c: "A middle ground is best."
 beastborn_no_interference_tooltip: "Your prospects will have improved [skills|E] and may develop [martial|E] or [intrigue|E] related [traits|E]"
 beastborn_full_interference_tooltip: "Your prospects will have slightly improved [skills|E] and may end up more docile"
 wait_time_beastborn_tooltip: "Your choices of approach now being made, you will have to wait for a sign of First Change among your animal kin. This will likely take several years."
 
 POD_fera_beastborn.12.t: "Playing Buddy"
 POD_fera_beastborn.12.desc: "The animal kin you are attending today are in a playful mood. Already recognizing you as a friend of their brood, they gather around you, looking inquisitively while obviously waiting for you to entertain them. Opening their horizons by introducing new concepts using games is certainly something you can do if you have the time."
 POD_fera_beastborn.12.a: "Playtime it is!"
 POD_fera_beastborn.12.b: "Not today friends."
 beastborn_more_diplomacy_tooltip: "The [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] that will later join your court will start with more diplomacy." 
 
 POD_fera_beastborn.13.t: "Storytelling Nature"
 POD_fera_beastborn.13.desc: "No signs of the First Change in your local animal kin yet but that doesn't mean that you can't spend time with them. While they lack the worldly knowledge of your kind, your animal cousins still instinctively listen to you. As they gather around you, wondering what you will do, you ponder if you have time to tell them a story. You speak their language after all and this could be a good way to prepare potential future $glossary_fera$ to the world beyond."
 POD_fera_beastborn.13.a: "Stay a while and listen."
 POD_fera_beastborn.13.b: "Perhaps not."
 beastborn_more_learning_tooltip: "The [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] that will later join your court will start with more learning." 
 
 POD_fera_beastborn.14.t: "Wrath of Nature"
 POD_fera_beastborn.14.desc: "Thanks to your careful monitoring, you recently learned that poachers have been encroaching in your animal kin's habitat. This will be the last mistake they make.\nWhile their death is already a done deal, you ponder if you could subtly help your animal kin fend for itself, hopefully having them learn and grow in the process. Otherwise, you could simply end this threat on your own quite easily."
 POD_fera_beastborn.14.a: "Nature strikes back."
 POD_fera_beastborn.14.b: "I will deal with them myself."
 beastborn_more_martial_tooltip: "The [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] that will later join your court will start with more martial." 
 
 POD_fera_beastborn.15.t: "Overbearing Parent"
 POD_fera_beastborn.15.desc: "You have been a little too overprotective of your animal kin recently. They have grown numerous thanks to plentiful preys and few predators, and the usual harsh laws of nature have been softened quite a bit by your watchful presence. A simple solution to restore balance would be to move some of them to a new environment, hopefully leading them into learning and adapting from this new struggle. You could also just let this situation slide, having happy and plentiful animal kin in your area is far from a curse anyway."
 POD_fera_beastborn.15.a: "Time for a change."
 POD_fera_beastborn.15.b: "Never too much of a good thing."
 beastborn_more_stewardship_tooltip: "The [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] that will later join your court will start with more stewardship." 
 
 POD_fera_beastborn.16.t: "Gifted One"
 POD_fera_beastborn.16.desc: "One of your animal kin has shown great promise recently with wits and craftiness aplenty. While not the most strong or impressive specimen, some in your court still see these talents as a sign of greatness and certain First Change in the future. No one truly understands what really makes one experience the First Change however so you are unsure about joining in this chorus of praise. What if the spirits disagree?"
 POD_fera_beastborn.16.a: "Clearly, they are the one!"
 POD_fera_beastborn.16.b: "We can't know for sure."
 beastborn_more_intrigue_tooltip: "The [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] that will later join your court will start with more intrigue." 
 
 POD_fera_beastborn.20.t: "New Generation"
 POD_fera_beastborn.20.desc: "The animal population of your area has recently experienced a First Change. Your monitoring of their activities paid off and your agents were the first on site, helping ease the traumatic experience for the new $glossary_fera$ and hide their trail for any prospective hunters. Grateful, they now joined your court ready to discover the wider world and your worthy cause."
 POD_fera_beastborn.20.a: "Welcome!"
 POD_fera_beastborn.20.b: "I don't need more [GetTrait('beast_born').GetName( GetPlayer )] in the future."




 POD_fera_beastborn.50.t: "A Worthy Cub?"
 POD_fera_beastborn.50.werewolf: "As a lupus-born, you often have encounters with your non werewolf kind in the forests. Sometimes, these encounters result in new cubs being born.\nThese cubs end up as mundane wolves the vast majority of the time and escape your notice quickly. Sometimes though, one of them experience the First Change and becomes a full fledged werewolf like you did.\nAs a lupus-born, they will need to be taught about the world outside the forests before being useful. But if you are willing to make that effort, they could join you, continuing your legacy for the next generation."
 POD_fera_beastborn.50.bastet: "As a feline-born, you often have encounters with your non Bastet kind in the wilderness. Sometimes, these encounters result in new cubs being born.\nThese cubs end up as mundane wild cats the vast majority of the time and escape your notice quickly. Sometimes though, one of them experience the First Change and becomes a full fledged Bastet like you did.\nAs a feline-born, they will need to be taught about the world outside the wilderness before being useful. But if you are willing to make that effort, they could join you, continuing your legacy for the next generation."
 POD_fera_beastborn.50.option.a: "A fine addition."
 POD_fera_beastborn.50.option.b: "[beastborn_1.GetHerhim|U] is not worthy"
 POD_fera_beastborn.50.tooltip: "You will adopt [beastborn_1.GetHerHim] as your own"
 POD_fera_beastborn.50.tooltip_redtalon: "[GetDynastyPerk('redtalon_legacy_4').GetName] gives [beastborn_1.GetHerHim] additional prowess."
