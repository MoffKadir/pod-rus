 podregionalevents.2.t: "Baybars Purge: Kindlings"
 podregionalevents.2.desc: "The current mortal Sultan of Egypt is a Mameluke, a Turkish slave bought and raised to fight, who managed to rise to the top with a brilliant (and ruthless) efficiency surprising many. After dealing conclusively with the Crusaders (by poisoning every well in their area and creating a desert), this Baybars is now worryingly turning his attention to the supernatural in Egypt.\nHe seems very well informed, way more than any mortal should, and is backed by an as of yet mysterious group. Combined with his unshakable courage and great practice with rooting our enemies, Baybars is proving to be a genuine threat to the Egyptian supernatural, with many roots of their influence already being unearthed and (sometimes literally) burned down.\nSome worried vampires and other targeted creatures are already considering exile as a preferable alternative to this danger, reasoning that Baybars is still a mortal, and time will catch up to him eventually."
 podregionalevents.2.a: "Time to visit new lands..."
 podregionalevents.2.custom: "You liquidate your assets and run away from Egypt.\nYou will still be informed of Baybars' whereabouts but won't be a direct target of his in the future."

 podregionalevents.3.t: "Baybars Purge: Idolatry"
 podregionalevents.3.desc: "Most of the supernatural in Egypt hails from an older time when multiple gods were venerated in this land. To Baybars' and his zealot Mamelukes, they are nothing more than idolaters worshiping pagan deities or even darker entities. As he increases his efforts in rooting out any supernatural being in his Sultanate, Baybars is now especially targeting "pagan" shrines and other old relics of a bygone era.\nAs efficient as ever, his tactics are proving very effective at destroying many countless artifacts and prized symbols of ancient Egypt held by the supernatural.\nIf they aren't caught in the fires themselves, it seems that the Egyptian vampires and other creatures will have little to remember their faith by in the future."

 podregionalevents.4.t: "Baybars Purge: Burning Assets"
 podregionalevents.4.desc: "Baybars and his Mamelukes are still running rampant in Egypt and even increasing their drive to uproot the supernatural. Efforts to counter them have been largely unsuccessful, mostly because of Baybars' mysterious patrons. These elusive figures use more subtle tactics than the Sultan and are mostly interested in destroying any support their foes could have prepared in Egypt. As such, many vampires and even other creatures have found their power bases, often decades in the making, suddenly targeted by the more shadowy agents of Baybars.\nThose who tried to resist by force of arms soon found themselves on the pyres so the only solution, besides exile, seems to be covering existing assets under even more layers of deception than usual. Not an easy feat against those foes that seem very capable at finding out supernatural influence."

 podregionalevents.5.desc: "Baybars is once again ramping up his campaign of destruction against the supernatural. This time, he has taken of using the tactics that helped him win against the crusaders: scorched earth. After all, if there are no communities to hide in for his enemies, they would be much easier to find.\nHis Mamelukes are now rampaging across the country, looking at any rumor of the presence of a vampire as an excuse to burn and destroy. While certainly ruthless, it's hard to deny the effectiveness of this strategy as more and more supernaturals are forced to take on to the field to protect their herd, cult or even families. Some however just have chosen to join others into exile."

 podregionalevents.6.desc: "Baybars is once again ramping up his campaign of destruction against the supernatural. Mamelukes are now seemingly found everywhere, supported by the mysterious cult helping the Sultan since the beginning, and are ruthless to eliminate anything (or anyone) tangentially related to $POD_splat_vampire_plural$, $glossary_fera$ and other creatures. Nobody knows how they manage to be apparently always at the right place at the right time but it is certainly paying off for them.\nAs the net tightens around the few brave who choose to remain in Egypt, they are forced to more and more extreme measures. Stories abound of once powerful creatures reduced to hiding in the desert sand, hoping to catch a break from Baybars' relentless pursuit."

According to legends, this was the first temple ever created by Set himself and housed the torpid body of the powerful vampire for a long time. Since then, it has served as the main capital for the Followers of Set and has never been endangered... until now.\nBacked by his veteran Mamelukes and the order of mysterious hunters helping him, Baybars is now laying siege to the ancient fortress, determined to end the shadowy rule of the supernatural ancient vampires over the faithful Egyptians of today. Ombos' defenses are mighty, but undermanned with the flight of many of its defenders during the earlier nights of the purge. The result of the battle is still uncertain, but seems to be in the Sultan's favor."

 podregionalevents.8.desc: "Despite the best efforts of the remaining Setites in Egypt, Baybars finally found one of the biggest prizes of all: the Fire Court. A bastion of Setite orthodoxy, the Fire Court is the second most powerful temple (besides Ombos itself) of the clan, and has served as a repository for occult knowledge and teaching methods for millennia now. It has never been endangered... until now.\nBacked by his veteran Mamelukes and the order of mysterious hunters helping him, Baybars is now laying siege to the ancient fortress, determined to end the shadowy rule of the supernatural ancient vampires over the faithful Egyptians of today. The Court's defenses are mighty, but undermanned with the flight of many of its defenders during the earlier nights of the purge. The result of the battle is still uncertain, but seems to be in the Sultan's favor."

 podregionalevents.15.t: "Baybars Purge: Just A Mortal Man"
 podregionalevents.15.desc: "In the end, mortal men are still mortal men. For all the terror he inflicted upon the Egyptian supernaturals, Baybars died rather quietly. Some say at the hand of a Banu Haqim assassin, but others simply talk of an infected wound or even a common illness. With his passing, the momentum behind his purge has completely died down and his shadowy allies have retreated back to where they came from. Exiled princes and $glossary_fera$ warchiefs alike are sighing in relief and returning to their cities and Egypt seems once again safe for the inhabitants of its shadowy self.\nSome are openly wondering what would have happened if Baybars' efforts were followed by more rulers however and the fear of what the mortals can actually accomplish will stay well and truly present in many Egyptian vampires' mind for a long time."

 podregionalevents.12.desc: "You are one of the few brave souls that has chosen to stay in Egypt despite Baybars' rampage against your kind. This was a dangerous move but this also has opened some opportunities. You have managed to gather some intelligence on the Sultan's whereabouts and his benefactors, the Nur al-Allah (the Light of God).\nWith a little more reconnaissance, you could try to confront the man himself. Doing such a thing would be extremely dangerous obviously as you would basically be on your own against the Mameluke's personal guard and his sorcerous acolytes. But the prospect of putting this impressive man on his knees before the thing he so hates has quite the appeal..."

You managed to breach his palace and create a distraction to even the odds, but the Sultan might not be the most pressing threat. While certainly an accomplished fighter, Baybars is just a mortal, which cannot be said for his shadowy patrons of the Nur al-Allah.\nWhile many of them are distracted or occupied elsewhere, even the small number of remaining ones protecting the Mameluke prove to be a deadly defense. At this stage though, there is no turning back possible anymore, they won't let you escape alive.\nThis won't be easy."

 podregionalevents.20.t: "The War for Livonia"
 podregionalevents.20.desc: "Lord Jürgen, two major problems are torturing your mind at the moment. First, the Ferals of Livonia have recently crushed a contingent of Knights of the Black Cross send to convert them and the knights' last holdings in Prussia are under a lot of pressure. Second, Alexander of Paris, the exiled lord of France, is a constant thorn in your side and his demands for support to reclaim his throne are becoming more pressing by the night. Luckily, the shrewd Lady Rosamund has offered a potential solution to both in a recent court session.\nThe plot is simple. Send Alexander to direct the remaining Knights of Black Cross and crush Livonia. If he wins? You would have subdued the pagans and Alexander would have your support to march on Paris. If he loses? Well, he would be out of your (and Lady Rosamund) hair at least. A win win truly."
 podregionalevents.20.a: "Lord Alexander, I have an offer..."
 podregionalevents.20.b: "I can deal with Alexander and Qarakh myself."
 podregionalevents.20.tt: "If Alexander accepts, he will leave for Prussia and you will get his holdings back."
 
 podregionalevents.16.desc: "Lord Alexander, your reluctant host, Jürgen von Verden, has recently offered you an intriguing mission. You would take command of the remaining Knights of the Black Cross in Prussia, receive reinforcements from Germany, then march on the Ferals of Livonia. Those barbaric Gangrel have recently delivered a crushing trashing to the Knights, hence the current situation.\nThis could be a solid first step towards your triumphal return to Paris, battle hardened German knights at your command and prestige from a glorious victory yours as well. Even the fair Lady Rosamund encourages you to pursue this noble quest to be worthy of her undying love."
 podregionalevents.16.a: "A good first step towards my return."
 podregionalevents.16.b: "I have other plans."
 podregionalevents.16.tt: "You will take over the remaining Knights of the Black Cross holdings in Prussia and give Mersenburg back to Jürgen."
 
 podregionalevents.17.desc: "Lord Alexander, you have arrived in Prussia and did your legwork about your new neighbors. This Qarakh seems impressive (for a savage Gangrel) and you must admit a small modicum of respect for the prowess his tribe is showing. This has made you wonder if an alternative course of action wouldn't be possible. You could extend an alliance offer to this man, using his warriors to your advantage and consolidating your position here. Obviously, this would mean foregoing the reinforcements promised by Jürgen and there is no assurance that the Gangrel would accept anyway. It might be safer to just follow the initial plan, crush the Ferals, then use the Germans' help to go back to Paris."
 podregionalevents.17.a: "Let's just mop up these barbarians."
 podregionalevents.17.b: "Send for a meeting with the chieftain."
 podregionalevents.17.tt: "If Qarakh accepts, you will ally him but gain no additional troops from the Black Cross. If Qarakh refuses, you will go to war but with less reinforcements as Jürgen gets wind of your plot."
 
 podregionalevents.18.desc: "Chieftain Qarakh, you just received news that the Knights of the Black Cross once again launched an attack on your outlying villages. While you crushed their first attempt a decade ago, you were under no illusion that this would be the end. Deverra warned you that the leader of this specific expedition, Alexander, is no mere German lieutenant. He is the powerful exiled Prince of Paris with age and powers far exceeding your own.\nWith such a fearsome for at their head and a much higher number of knights this time around, your tribe might be overwhelmed. Still, you are no coward and if war is needed to protect your people, then war is what you will give this arrogant Ventrue."
 podregionalevents.18.a: "We were prepared for this."
  
 podregionalevents.19.desc: "Chieftain Qarakh, as expected the Knights of the Black Cross are back. Thanks to Deverra's forewarning, you were prepared for this eventuality and are ready for war. You weren't ready however for their new leader to extend an hand in friendship to you.\nApparently, this Alexander of Paris is an exiled Prince with little love for the German Christians. His eyes are focused on the reconquest of his French throne and he offers an alliance with your tribe. You would agree to help him reconquer France when the time is right. For his part, he would stall the Knights of the Black Cross' attacks on your land as long as he is in power, securing your tribe for the foreseeable future. You know that he probably intends to use your people as fodder for his wars but nobody said that the alliance would be eternal... This temporary reprieve might be exactly what you need."

Most prominent among them is Francois d'Alencourt, the Prince of Lyon. While he isn't especially a friend of yours, he is loyal to a fault and thus disliked the deceitful coup pulled against you. It should be easy to convince him to bend the knee and help your triumphant return.\nThere is also the small matter that you betrayed Jürgen von Verden by allying with Qarakh and keeping Prussia for yourself. But, frankly, who cares what a lowly German Prince thinks? He should have jumped at the occasion to help you when you first graced his court with your presence, not made you jump through these annoying hoops."

Even the leadership of the powerful Alexander wasn't enough to break your spirit. Despite the celebrations going on in Livonia, you are well aware that the Germans are still a threat. It is why you were surprised to hear that Jürgen von Verden called for a peace negotiation.\nThe man (much more palatable than Alexander, you have to admit) doesn't seem that fussed about the latest defeat. If anything, you have the impression that he is welcoming your victory for some unknown reason. He accepts a 20 years peace treaty between Livonia and the Black Cross without much convincing.
