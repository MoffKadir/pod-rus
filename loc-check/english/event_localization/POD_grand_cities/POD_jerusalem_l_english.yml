[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('790368').GetFirstName] is responsible for her $pod_Embrace$, an event that occurred within the depths of Knossos' Labyrinth. It is said that after [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('790368').GetFirstName]'s fall during the Second Baali War, Namtaru himself left an imprint upon her soul which fed upon her hatred towards the Baali that betrayed her [Glossary('Sire','game_concept_Sire_desc')].\nLong after, she briefly resurfaced in Carthage to bind Troile and Moloch before salting the land. Supposedly, she returned to the ruins of Knossos, but we have found evidence indicating that she came to Jerusalem and might now be the beast in the pit.\n\nHowever, there are abnormalities in her tale. Some say she was a Malkavian and the leader of a cult. Others focus on her $pod_Embrace$ of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('790217').GetFirstName], mother of Alexander the Great, or [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('791970').GetFirstName], author of the [GetGlobalVariable('dreams_angra_link').Artifact.GetName], though these lineages are sometimes ascribed to others."

 POD_jerusalem.5.desc: "After much work, we have combined [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('790147').GetFirstName]'s story with certain artifacts in our possessions.\n\nIt would seem the [Glossary('Antediluvian','game_concept_antediluvian_desc')] Malakai has been stricken from most Cainite records. However, we have pieced together some of what happened. Like her brother Set, Malakai sought to be a god among men. Like her brother Malkav, Malakai was plagued by visions of the future, haunted by the image of Caine empowered by God Himself to judge the Cursed Ones.\n\nIt was close to this moment that Saulot created a $pod_clan$ capable of raising him to godhood first, of granting command over the next turn of the Wheel, and of resisting Caine's coming judgement. In one attempt, he killed hundreds in a fell swoop, using it to call a "Child of the Outer Dark" (a powerful demon?). When the sacrifice was done, the first of what would become known as the Baali crawled from the pit. Was it the pit we are currently investigating? This is hard to say, as some texts point it to a location named Chorazin instead.\n\nA great many events followed this with Saulot allowing Tremere to diablerize him to create yet another $pod_clan$ in service of his ultimate goal, Malkav (apparently) allowing his childer to diablerize him after a near-fatal encounter with another [Glossary('Antediluvian','game_concept_antediluvian_desc')] and now using all of his descendants through shards of himself embedded in them to further his own quest for ascension or enlightenment, and Malakai herself falling into $pod_torpor$ beneath the ruins of Ketef Hinnom.\nAnother version thinks that it's Malkav that is here instead, or at least the bloody remains of his long gone corporeal form.\n\nWhether they come from Malkav or Malakai, these powerful entities' dreams are clearly still affecting the surrounding region, driving those teetering on the brink of anything from madness to murder into overwhelming fits of mania and bloodlust."

Their tears and wails echo in our minds while their half-alive bodies writhe in agony on the ground.\n\nOur minds are overwhelmed with images of a horrifying future. Countless men and women prostrate themselves before great golden statues. Inverted pyramids made of iron and black stone plunge into the depths of the Earth. Gaudily displayed within them are sacrificial altars where weeping captives are slowly sliced to death over agonizing weeks with serrated knives of obsidian.\n\nFactories made of mutilated flesh and metal powered by brimstone forges churn out endless weapons to fuel the machinations of the pit's denizen.

Eventually, the stairs open up into a maze-like network of caves which loop and twist and turn in a manner that our best cartographers can barely map. Endless pathways and rooms filled with furniture that shifts every time you return to the room. Is it the same room? When we walk in a straight line, we somehow arrive back at a point where we marked the wall.\n\nBut, we didn't mark a wall with moss on it, did we?  When we turn a corner, we are in a corridor that shares the space of another corridor and yet goes in a different direction or have we always being going in this direction?\n\nThe visions will not cease, and we are unaided by the local denizens who wander listlessly, forever searching for the path further downward where they may receive their promised rewards.

As we traverse this new disc, lost souls wallow like blind and deaf maggots, wriggling in a putrid slime that covers every surface. They cry out for a great many things from food to drink, from drugs to pleasure, for all things that addict the souls of man.\n\nBefore the door to the next level sits a voracious beast, that resembles both a rabid wolf and the great wyrms of myth.

Hundreds of moaning forms cry out from the upside-down crosses that ring the city. Plumes of smoke issue forth from hidden forges, and twisted imitations of our holy places stare down at us mockingly. All reminds us of our visions when we stood before the pit's maw.\n\nThis is our first time encountering intelligent and cognizant beings in this forsaken pit, and they bar our way towards the stairs going further down, saying we are not sufficiently devoted to their dark god.

In their abominable temples, they commit unspeakable acts and seek visions of the future so that they may know their master's will.\n\nA few revel in the pain as they allow the lake's fire to consume them. Should they survive through strength of will and brutal devotion, these so-called Baptized come forth as blackened skeletons whose eyes reflect the flames they endured. They possess strength greater than any but the strongest Cainite and serve as their new master's priests.\n\nThankfully, the newly-Baptized care only about returning to the city above us.

The first is the Bloody Sea which quenches the thirst of the pit's denizens, born from the blood spilt by humanity. The second is the Wailing Woods whose wood fuels the pit's forges and whose trees are made of transfigured beings that cast aside their own bodies but still did not meet the expectations of the pit's lord.

Servants of the pit's true master roam the aisles of seats, the stage, and the backstage, casting their evil magicks and potent rites. While the others used brute force, these despicable beings channel their master's power through the remnants of their bodies which grants them the power to warp the world in their master's twisted image through belief and willpower.\n\nAbove it all hangs a starless void, a disconcerting facsimile of the sky shaped by our divine Lord. The only source of light in that void is a moon-like circle, illuminating the world sprawled beneath it with its red glow.\n\nFinally, we see the signs which indicate the presence of a nearby staircase.
