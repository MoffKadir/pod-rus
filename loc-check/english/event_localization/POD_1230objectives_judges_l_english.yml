 pod1230objectives_judges.1.desc: "During his time serving kings of Babylon and Persia, the prophet Dani'el became chief among the Magi. With his knowledge of sorcery and the wisdom of G-d, Dani'el became Chief of the Magi and taught them the mysteries of the Tanakh to guide them in their craft. They studied the stars for signs of the future and more linear paths of the traditional theurgy taught by the secret Talmud.\n\nWith the rise of the Cursed Ones and Fallen in the region, the Magi have been widely discarded as court advisors and have been forced to retreat into the Geonic academies. Their powers may be an enigma to us but are clearly born from the teachings of the prophet Dani'el, making them allies. After having retaken the hub of their activity, we have been able to establish contact with them for the first time in centuries. With their wisdom and the help of the Mizrahim Judges, we can pass on secrets once held by just a few and reinforce our eternal fight against those hiding in the shadows."

The Cursed Ones do not wish to involve themselves in our hunt, only protecting our mortal brethren. While a few more zealous Judges may take issue with this, we are grateful for their aid in defending our brethren and in finding the secret to creating golems.\nBetween them and the local Judges, we have advanced the knowledge of construct crafting tenfold. Let us use these golems to protect our communities and root out those preying on us from the shadows."

However, the Esra'elawi Judges in Abyssinia have maintained the ancient warrior traditions of our people, specifically the tribe of Dan. The Setites, Undying, Laibon, and Ashirra are constantly attempting to wipe out our brethren in Beta Israel, forcing the Esra'elawi Judges to master the craft of war.\nNow that we have made contact and proven ourselves as able to help them, they have passed on their oldest teachings. With this foundation, we can ensure that the traditions are maintained within our dynasty, aiding us in our quest to eliminate Caine and Lilith's brood."

Some were once traders under the command of King Solomon to reach unseen shores. Others came here, fleeing one of the two Exiles. Their Judges must face just as many threats, whether it be the Indian Cursed Ones, Cursed Ones coming from the west, or the Hungry Dead coming from further east.\n\nThe Kochinim have mastered two areas, allowing them to survive, and have now gifted that mastery to us. They control a massive trade network spanning India and the nearby region to fuel the Judges, and they have built an intelligence network on top of the trade to aid the Judges in their hunts."

These skills have transferred to their local Judges and made them among the most effective of our brethren.\n\nIt took some time and effort, but we managed to bring the Sephardim to our side and to help ease their situation.

His [Glossary('Sire','game_concept_Sire_desc')] is unknown, though Ilyes (progenitor of $pod_clan$ Brujah) is a common contender in some of our scholars' circles partially due to the theory placing Isis (Osiris' wife) as a descendant of Lilith.\n\nSomeone (our scholars point to Ilyes, Lilith, or a mage named Thoth) would later return to aid Isis and Nephthys in their pursuit of magical knowledge, expanding the knowledge already known by Isis herself.\n\nWith their magicks (and maybe by exploiting the absence of Bene Elohim to properly ferry the dead?), the Undying forever bound souls to their own bodies such that their soul could eventually return to the physical world after regaining its strength in [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')].\n\nWhile the Egyptian Undying or Mummies are frequently warring against the Cursed Ones (maybe being used by Lilith?), the other Undying have managed to avoid entangling themselves in that conflict and seem to have discovered distinct means of achieving a similar end result, even the alchemical abilities.\n\nExcerpts from a preliminary draft of the Havanah Vol. 21, Ch. 1 & 2"

 pod1230objectives_judges.7.desc: "... and so it was that one-third of the Bene Elohim joined Lucifer in his rebellion, driven by their greed and pride. Some believed that their plan was wiser than that of YHWH. Others sought supreme authority over humanity, YHWH's own power, or simply wished to destroy all that they saw as impure or as rivals to G-d's love. Still others found the new concepts of war and violance introduced by Caine fascinating. Regardless of their individual reasons, they rebelled against HIS perfect plan and to the surprise of none, lost the war against HIS faithful.\nFor their actions, they were cast out of the 3rd Heaven, forever bound to the Earth they so coveted and the 1st Heaven. They were trapped in a land called the Abyss, able to escape only through the sin and hubris of mortals. On Earth and in the Abyss, they would await the Final Judgment when they would be consigned to Gehinnom ...\n\nFor his crime of inciting the rebellion, Lucifer received an additional curse. Just as the Earth had been turned over to the Fallen for a time, so too were the Fallen turned over to their depravities. Lucifer would stand, untouched by the Abyss or sin's worst twistings, so that he could witness all those he rallied under him slowly twist and give into the corruption they had spawned, wishing for nothing but his own destruction ...\n\nTwice now have Asmodeus and Abaddon sought to replace men with twisted thralls they called Nephilim and twice now has G-d intervened with their plans. In the first instance, the Great Flood wiped out all traces of those tainted bloodlines. In response to the second, a new faith arose from our own, one that would be named Christianity.\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 11, Ch. 2 & Vol. 18, Ch. 7"

 #pod1230objectives_judges.9.desc: "In the ninth chapter of his book, Daniel began a count from Mar 14, 445BC, as the Gentiles reckon it, when we received the order to rebuild the Second Temple. He said that the Mashiach would come 483 of our years later. As it was said, so it was done for Yeshua passed through the gates of Jerusalem on the Tenth of Nisan precisely 483 years later to be cut off and left with nothing. As Daniel warned us, our city and G-d's temple were cast down as punishment for missing this sign.\n\nLet it now be known across the land that Mashiach ben Yosef has come!

 pod1230objectives_judges.9.desc: "The man commonly known as Yeshua of Nazareth has been an enigma to us for a long time. Some of our scholars believe he is in truth an Undying called Melchizedek. Like many Undying, he would possess the capability of mimicking resurrection, reawakening into his own body after a certain amount of time. This view is supported by reports that his tomb was found empty other the burial linens, a common characteristic for the Undying ...\n\nThis somewhat wild speculation still lacks credible sources and our order has agreed to keep it at just that, an hypothesis, to avoid angering our fellow Christian hunters. Cooperation with them has proven fruitful many times in the past and keeping our theological differences unsaid while focusing on the true threat is a much more pragmatic, and efficient, approach.\n\nDraft from the Havanah Vol. 21, Ch. 16, never published outside of higher Judges circles."

As His lesser reflections, humanity can make real their dreams and nightmares. The Fae are created when humanity literally creates things from their dreams and nightmares, reflecting the ideals and fears of anyone in the local area ...\n\nTheir connection to belief means that reality, pessimism, a lack of wonder, and a lack of chaos are all capable of physically injuring them or restricting their powers ...\n\nCold iron, beaten into order through sheer willpower, is known to easily destroy these beings of dreams ...\n\nFae are currently evil beings, reflections of the wilderness and its beasts as they seek to destroy civilization. However, sufficient changes in general beliefs, values, and fears may result in changes to the nature of Fae and transform them into useful allies in the hunt. The exception would be those calling themselves the Shedim, so-called Djinn which we think were born from the dreams of Lilith and her brood. They will forever carry her taint.\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 51, Ch. 1 & 3 and Vol. 52, Ch. 20"

In this essay, I will demonstrate how ...\n\n Without the Fallen to serve as psychopomps and ferry the dead into the afterlife, they began to collect upon the Earth and even began to overwhelm the living. Worse, some Fallen actively sought to collect the souls of the dead in a land cloaked by a Veil of pain and suffering ...\n\nIn time, the faithful Bene Elohim pierced this Veil, captured the Fallen, and brought them before G-d for judgment ...\n\nUnwilling to condemn the many souls captured in this place's trap by simply destroying the realm, G-d spoke and the oceans parted and the Veil was placed between the two oceans. One side was given to the living and the other side, [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')], was given over to the restless dead who were as yet unwilling to pass on ...\n\nG-d empowered Eve, the first woman and a mother who still sought to make peace with her son, to select a protector for the restless dead. To fight the dark taints left in [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')], she chose a therianthrope, one of the werewolves, who would become known as Anubis, at least to the Undying he aided. This taint corrupts all souls trapped in this realm, always whispering their ears to succumb to all that is Dark ...\n\nIn the same century that Moses parted the Red Sea though it is unknown whether there is a correlation, Eve returned to select a governor for the restless dead. The name of [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')]'s Fallen creator was given to a Mycenaean, transferring some of the Fallen's power of the realm and allowing the Mycenaean to separate the living from the dead and to aid the dead in reaching the afterlife. He became known as Charon ...\n\nAnything not created by G-d Himself must eventually come to an end for all creations cannot be perfect creators. That which is known as [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('oblivion','Oblivion')] is the essence of this. It is the inevitable end, destruction, and corruption of this strange land originally created by the Fallen. There is no will nor intelligence here, simply entropy which renders all information incoherent and all energy useless made manifest by the evils of the Fallen and the fears of the Wraiths trapped in this strange land.\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 23, Ch. 1, 2, 5, & 6"

Based on their naming schemes, the First Age refers to the time when the Earth was without form and was void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Their Second Age began when G-d separated the light from the darkness and separated the waters. It ended with the Fall which created all manner of evil beings, only some of which were the Fallen. In response to the Fall, G-d, known as the August Personage of Jade in the East, chose an angel to select 10 thousand heroes, protectors, and guides for humanity ...\n\nTainted as all men are by the Original Sin, these heroes were corrupted by their power, stealing the life of those in their care to empower themselves and making deals with the Fallen for yet more power. The Bene Elohim were barely able to replace all those that died in their internal conflicts, spurred on by their pride and desire for more glory ...\n\nTheir evils culminated in the War of Shame when they killed their own children, corrupted holy sites blessed by G-d and guarded by the dragons and weres, and created the Nine False Suns ...\n\nEven the tests of selection were corrupted such that only the evil would join their number ...\n\nUnable to withhold judgment or grant them mercy any longer, G-d levied a curse upon the 10 thousand former heroes with only four spared, one of whom would go on to join that which he had once fought. This curse granted them a glimpse of the torment awaiting them in the afterlife and stripped them of the powers once granted to them, forcing them to drain humans for energy if they wished to retain those powers. These once-heroes were not the only beings in the area trapped in the physical realm, and not all have remained trapped for G-d is merciful, always leaving a path to reunion for those willing to tread it ...\n\nThere is a common misconception that those now known as Kuei-Jin are restricted to the eastern regions of Asia and Oceania. In reality, these former heroes and escaped criminals can arise anywhere. However, the Cursed Ones exterminate them in regions where they are prevalent, seeing them simply as caitiff wights or unusually strong wraiths. Historically, the Therianthropes saw themselves as more faithful so developed a hatred and disgust towards the Kuei-Jin.\nWhile the reasons have been forgotten, the hatred remains so therianthropes similarly exterminate any newborn Kuei-Jin in their territory. Only the East possessed sufficiently few or open-minded Cursed Ones and therianthropes for the Kuei-Jin to take root, at which point they could ease the transition and insertion of future Kuei-Jin.\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 46, Ch. 1, 3, & 9 and Vol. 50, Ch. 4"

 pod1230objectives_judges.14.desc: "After the Fall, G-d chose an angel to select 10 thousand heroes and protectors for humanity. This angel chose the souls of faithful mortals who had died at the hands of the Fallen and gave them a second chance at life. Reborn as the Malhim, these souls matched the brutality that they had once been shown, striking fear into the hearts of all Fallen with their eagerness to exterminate the Fallen. They could follow and hunt their prey into any corner of creation, even piercing the realm of [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')]. Blessed by their patron, they could demand the aid of nature, both flora and fauna. In fact, they could even transform into different animals to aid them in their hunts and battles, with the werebears being the oldest and wisest among them ...\n\nAt that time, they were divided by who they hunted or their role in supporting the Heavenly Hosts. For example, those now known as Rokea primarily hunted House Lammasu while the Khan Bastet were grouped with other therianthropes as heavy troopers ...\n\nLike so many others, these heroes succumbed to the temptations of their positions and power. They enslaved humanity, keeping them as livestock much as the Cursed Ones did. For their crimes, they were cursed with the nature of the animals they worked alongside and resembled. In time, the once mighty Malhim devolved into the beings we today know as Therianthropes ...\n\nSome scholars have posited that the War of Rage caused the ultimate collapse from Malhim into Therianthropes. There were many territorial conflicts, contests for the best herds of people, attempts to determine the strongest race, and alleged betrayals of their Patron Mother. Everything culminated when a Fallen-corrupted Nagah killed an important Garou who was carrying an important message and laid the blame on other tribes. When the Gurahl refused to resurrect the Garou courier, the Garou attacked the Gurahl who struck back with their own allies among the Grondr. With the war having started, the Garou took advantage of it to fulfill their every desire: their pride, their greed for the secrets of others, and their belief in their right to rule over all other tribes ...\n\nAn interesting note regarding the Therianthropes is their unique connection to certain bodies seen in the Second Heaven. Based on our research into [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')], the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('dreaming','Dreamland')], and other Umbral realms, it would seem most, if not all, heavenly bodies are manifestations of humanity's dreams and beliefs such that the bodies may not have existed before humanity decided that those stars should be distinct from the others.

 pod1230objectives_judges.15.desc: "Humanity has turned its back on G-d many, many times. All sons of Adam and daughters of Eve bear the mark of the Original Sin. Caine created the Cursed Ones through his numerous crimes, from murder to rape and even his refusal to repent. Many humans joined the Fallen in their rebellion against G-d ...\n\nWhile He has turned His face from us for now, he has never forgotten humanity. Discussion of the Ha-mashiach and the chosen nature of the children of Israel are beyond the scope of this work so please consult the appropriate volumes and rabbinical texts. Relevant to the current discussion, G-d left behind multiple workers to aid humanity, such as Eve and two Bene Elohim called Ziana of House Rabisu and Raziel of House Lammasu. The latter are titled the Messengers ...\n\nSoon after the Fall and even before the Great Flood, Raziel chose ten thousand heroes who fought with their beauty and their knowledge, ever helping humanity forward. These heroes inspired stories of the Wan Xian and much of their knowledge was passed on to the Wu T'ian, allowing them to create the Elixir of Eternal Life and somehow being tied to the Eight Immortals who even now work for G-d in the 3rd Heaven. The Eight Immortals still communicate with the Wu T'ian, giving them tasks on how to mitigate problems. Similarly, Ziana chose ten thousand heroes who fought with nature itself, controlling and taking on aspects of nature's flora and fauna. They could command plants to aid them and take on the form of the animal spirit that had chosen them. From the dreams of these heroes, blessed with unique magicks, came the beings known as the Fae. While modern dreams can alter the Fae, it was these first dreams which birthed the true Firstborn Fae ...\n\nWith the failure of their individual heroes, these two Messengers decided to combine their efforts and to alter the manner in which they worked. No longer would such powers be entrusted to a single person, instead being split up. Some abilities would be learned, with the Messengers encouraging people towards hidden knowledge through the Yearning. Other abilities would be granted at birth, to be explored over time. Still other powers would be granted as a reward for enduring something or as aid in enduring something, often accompanied by a message of guidance. (Translator Note: Why do the Messengers have to be so confusing with their guidance? Why can't it just be \"go here and do this\".) These abilities allow humans the ability to hear, see, and speak the mysteries that the fleshy ear, jellied eye, and tongue of clay could not. Each Blessed may approach and use their Gift in different ways and forms from esotericism, mysticism, alchemy, rituals, spells, prayers, meditation, and mental abilities ...\n\nOf Raziel's heroes, only 8 ever found true peace and were accepted back into G-d's arms. Inspired by the new efforts of Raziel and Ziana, these Eight Immortals passed on some of their knowledge to the Wu T'ian, allowing the Wu T’ian to create the Elixir of Eternal Life without relying on the twisted magicks of Lilith’s brood. The Eight Immortals actively communicate with the Wu T'ian, giving them seemingly-random and unrelated tasks ...\n\nThe goal of the Messengers and G-d's other agents is ultimately unknown, though some say that they are mitigating damage before it becomes too severe. Perhaps they are testing us? Time will tell ...\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 22, Ch. 1 & Vol. 31, Ch. 1 & Vol. 46, Ch. 4"

 pod1230objectives_judges.16.desc: "In His wisdom, G-d saw a way to address many sins at once and so He sent the Great Flood to wash away the abominations of the Fallen, the corrupted among His former servants, and the pride of the Cursed Ones ...\n\nIn the wake of the Great Flood, Caine exiled himself. He had created so much for it to be wiped away in a single year, with only a handful of the over 200 Cursed Ones surviving the Great Flood. Not that it mattered. Despite all of his work, nothing ever improved, just changed in small ways ...\n\nWithout Caine to restrain them, the Third Generation were allowed to fulfill their worst vices and their worst bouts of paranoia. When combined with the limited food supply as the children of Noah spread, the Third Generation quickly decided to turn against their surviving sires, forcing them into torpor but unable to fully kill them. Some say that Irad aided their efforts before they turned on him too. Others say that Zillah was the last to fall, crying out for Caine's aid as she saw her brothers fall. He heard her pleas and took pity on her, changing her into a stone so that she would not be found and killed. In addition, Caine promised his beloved Zillah that they would walk the night together again after all was mended. Still others say that Jabal managed to escape entirely, accompanying Caine in his exile as the ever-faithful servant ...\n\nInspiring many a myth of a vengeful deity, Caine's wrath was unrestrained when he heard of what happened to his advisor, general, and wife by their own childer. Sweeping into their so-called Second City, he placed three curses upon each of the 13 members of the Third Generation, one a personal amplification of the target's greatest flaws or fears and two general curses levied against all. Each [Glossary('Generation','game_concept_vampgeneration_desc')] removed from Caine would be weaker than the last, and no [Glossary('Generation','game_concept_vampgeneration_desc')] would ever know peace for all would be locked in an eternal struggle to supplant their predecessors. In fact, the Third Generation may have had power on par with Caine's direct childer before Caine levied his curses. Finally, Caine implanted an innate distrust and fear of the Fallen, encouraging his descendants to avoid the Fallen or wipe out their followers which potentially explains why the Baali Wars and the assault of Carthage are among the very few examples of numerous clans working together. Just as the Third Generation had tried, each [Glossary('Generation','game_concept_vampgeneration_desc')] would attempt to wipe out those before them, ever in fear of what the more powerful previous [Glossary('Generation','game_concept_vampgeneration_desc')] could do to them. These curses also served to amplify the tension between members of the same [Glossary('Generation','game_concept_vampgeneration_desc')], creating an ever-present fear of each other ...\n\nEven before Caine cursed them, the Third Generation sought to recreate the glory of Caine's city. They embraced new members of the Fourth Generation. They collected Noah's descendants to worship and feed them ...\n\n However, they could never shake Caine's curses. They wiped out anyone who attempted to Embrace their own childer. They turned every resident of their city into pawns, nothing more than a piece to be moved in an unimaginable game ...\n\nCaught up in their games, they never noticed as their city grew old and died around them. When they finally fled, it was nearly too late, and many of them died in their flight ...\n\nCaine laughed as he used his mastery of Dominate to alter all memories of this Second City, even eliminating its name. Little was left in the survivors' minds except how their city fell and the memories of their own failings.\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 1, Ch. 14 & 17"

 pod1230objectives_judges.17.desc: "In his wanderings, Caine developed two things: a lust for power and a desire for a new family. A chance to fulfill both came when a man called Enoch found him. The king and queen of Ubar (but that would make Ubar the First City?) sent out Enoch, their greatest citizen, to find their city a guardian and a god. Caine was the one Enoch brought back ...\n\nFor the first time, Caine embraced three people: Enoch for bringing him to Ubar and the king and queen of Ubar (speculation from an Arabic tome!) to preserve their love and wisdom. In the latter two, Caine hoped that their love could begin to mitigate his actions. However, they walked into the sun to die after discovering they could no longer give birth to true children. Caine swore never to embrace again, an oath which lasted until Enoch's words and Caine's own loneliness changed his mind ...\n\nIrad was the greatest general alive at the time, chosen by Caine to protect the city of Ubar. While his new nature improved his skills as a leader, it also increased Irad's bloodlust ...\n\nZillah awakened Caine's desire for a wife to accompany him through eternity, but she proved resistant to his charms so he sought other means of winning her affection. In his desperation, Caine sought out his father's second wife, Levatel, who had been cast out of the garden by Adam due to his revulsion from watching her creation. Promising to teach him the secret, she bonded Caine to herself, turning Caine into her thrall and slave. Through his bond, she forced Caine to embrace her (unlikely, no Cainites sources to back this) and stole some of his childer from the Second and Third Generations. However, while subject to the bond, Caine learned its secrets and prepared to kill Levatel. A year and a day after he was first enslaved, the bond faded enough for Caine to stake Levatel and leave her for the sun to kill. His childer that she had claimed and her own childer failed to save her, creating an eternal hatred of the Cainites which continued through the few that survived the Great Flood and led them to join Lilith's brood. With the blood bond, Caine bound Zillah to himself, though it is uncertain whether the bond created an illusion of love or whether she truly grew to love him in time ...\n\nRather than embracing him, Caine transformed the chief of his servants into the first ghoul or revenant. With power on par with the Third Generation, Jabal was the highest-ranking mortal in the First City ...\n\nCaine ruled Ubar with an iron fist, exiling or killing any Cursed Ones who broke his rules such as by consorting with the Fallen or murdering each other. Considering how many Third Generations were embraced without his permission, it is interesting that he never cracked down on that. Also, he was kinder than his childer to the mortals. Some say that he didn't want to risk his food source while other say that he still sought redemption for his acts, though the latter is unlikely considering Zillah's story and his religious prohibitions. Namely, Caine prohibited anyone from worshipping G-d and banned all temples that were not for himself or the other Cursed Ones. At his own temple, he frequently proclaimed how all of his childer were doomed to forever rot, to suffer in Hell should they ever die, and to be ignored by G-d when the apocalypse finally arrived ...\n\nIt is unknown how Enoch managed to convince everyone that Caine renamed Ubar after Enoch (did he or is this just speculation to reconcile Ubar and Enoch?). Perhaps he used Dominate to rewrite memories, or perhaps his childer, the most numerous of the three groups, managed to outshout everyone else.\n\nExcerpts from a discarded draft of the Havanah Vol. 1, Ch. 5-12"

 pod1230objectives_judges.18.desc: "Lilith was Adam's first wife and was cast out for two reasons: for her disobedience towards Adam's commands and for her infidelity with a Ben Elohim before the Original Sin and before the Fall. After wandering the wilds of G-d's creation, she returned to the Garden of Eden and convinced her angelic lover to grant her access. Using strange magicks stolen from the Bene Elohim, she transformed herself into the Serpent who tempted the naive Eve and encouraged the Original Sin ...\n\nDuring his wanderings, Caine encountered Lilith in her imitation of the Garden of Eden. She was enticed by G-d's mark denoting him as a murderer and the power it represented. She invited him into her home, fed him, bound his wounds, and became his lover. In time, Caine realized Lilith had strange magicks and pleaded with her to grant them to him whether in love or so that he mitigate G-d's curse. And so, Lilith prepared a special ceremony and fed Caine some of her lifeblood. After partaking of her blood, Caine was visited by the 4 Hayyot Bene Elohim and Archangels who bear the Divine Merkavah, each offering a chance to repent and each cursing him worse than the last as he refused them. When Caine declined him, Mikha'el (Who/none is like G-d) cursed Caine to fear his living fire. When Caine declined him, Rafa'el (G-d has healed) cursed Caine to fear the dawn for the sun's glory would burn like Mikha'el's living fire. When Caine declined him, Auri'el (G-d is my light) cursed Caine to cling to the shadows, to drink blood as he did in this ceremony and like his brother's blood he shed, to consume ashes left by Mikha'el's living fire, to freeze at the point of death, and to have all that they touch crumble into the dust from which all things are made. Gavri'el (G-d is my strength) offered one final chance which could not be declined and would never fade, the only remaining way to receive G-d's mercy and to lift the curse. When he awoke from these visions, Caine had received the 9 magicks that form the base of the modern Disciplines. After this, he abandoned Lilith for reasons unknown thereby creating the hatred Lilith and her brood still hold towards the Cainites. Some have postulated that G-d enforced His curse on Lilith for her part in the Original Sin now, ensuring that her monstrous brood would never work alongside the Cursed Ones ...\n\nLilith's current location is unknown as the Great Flood destroyed many traces of her activity, including her garden. Some sources state that she retreated into [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Limbo')] or the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('dreaming','Dreamland')] where she rebuilt her garden to wait for the day when she can wipe out all threats to her "children" and enact her terrible vengeance against Caine.

 pod1230objectives_judges.19.desc: "After Caine became a worker of the ground and Abel became a keeper of the sheep, Caine and Abel decided to bring offerings to YHWH. YHWH was pleased with Abel's sacrifice but not that of Caine. Caine did not provide his first produce nor the best of his produce. Worse, Caine offered sacrifices for the wrong reasons, to show  his prosperity and to earn the attention of his twin sister that he wished to marry. Caine was filled with fury at G-d ignoring his sacrifice. A soon-to-be Fallen, always having hated Abel's piety, excited Caine's anger and his jealousy, providing a dream of inspiration. Two beings resembling Caine and Abel came. Now, one reproached the other. The reproached one became angry with the other and took a beaten plowshare.\n\nIgnoring all begging for mercy, the reproached cut the other's throat and killed him. Maintaining the ember of anger and never permitting it to be extinguished, Caine became convinced that there was neither judgment nor Almighty Judge nor reward for the righteous nor vengeance against the wicked. His envy of his brother festered and only grew as their parents arranged for Abel to marry Caine's twin sister. Caine took up his plow, beat it to create a blade, approached his brother out in the fields, and sliced the throat of Abel. So it was that Caine spilt the blood of his brother Abel upon the earth, and the blood of Abel streamed upon the earth and his stomach was opened before the flock.\n\nG-d heard the cries of Abel and saw the future consequences so punished Caine. No longer would the ground yield its strength to Caine. Forever would he be a fugitive and a wanderer. However, G-d understood the influence of others in the situation and that as the first murderer, Caine lacked full understanding of his action's consequences. As such, Caine was simply cursed and was granted protection from anyone that might attack him.\n\nExcerpts from the Havanah Vol. 1, Ch. 1"

In His eternal mercy and despite Caine's refusal to accept the gift, G-d gave Caine and his descendants a way now called Golconda to remove their curse and to save their souls from eternal damnation. While it can be stated with some certainty that Caine had not achieved Golconda before the Great Flood, it has been millennia since then so scholars have made some very convincing arguments that Caine has likely achieved Golconda but has not yet passed into the afterlife because he must first resolve matters with his descendants. For further discussion of Caine's current status, please consult the commentaries and articles in Chapter 18 ...\n\nSaulot claimed to have achieved Golconda after stealing some of the knowledge granted to the Wan Xian's descendants by Raziel. He passed those teachings on to the Salubri clan, granting them their iconic third eye and leading many of them to Golconda. However, recent discoveries by local Judges point to the fact that Saulot himself never achieved Golconda. In addition, the Tremere have gone to great pains in their efforts to wipe out the Salubri in general and those who achieved Golconda in particular ...\n\nSaulot even stole the name from the Eastern mystics with the term poetically referring to the great spiritual wealth held by such transcendental beings. Ironically, those mystics hate the term Golconda because it is not the most accurate term so much as the one Saulot took and popularized among the Western Cursed Ones ...\n\nTo achieve Golconda, a Cursed One must find a mentor, retain or recover their humanity, and make amends for all of their sins. After sufficient research and meditation, they may experience some special insight. With that insight, they can finally begin a suspire which is a vision quest into their dreams and soul. During the suspire, they discover the point of existence, the origins of their inner Beast, and their connection to Caine. Should they fail to achieve Golconda during the suspire, they will never have another chance, if their body and mind even survives. The same is true should they fall out of Golconda by ever committing a sin ...\n\nShould it be achieved, Golconda removes the risk of a Cursed One being consumed by their inner Beast, nearly removes their need for blood, and negates the curses Caine placed on his descendants including the clan banes and the [Glossary('Generation','game_concept_vampgeneration_desc')] limits. In comparison to Lilith's brood, the Cainites are something we hunt due to their cruelty more than anything else. As such, those that have achieved Golconda are exempt from our hunts, allowing us to spend our resources eliminating far greater threats to our brethren.\n\nDiscarded draft from the Havanah Vol. 1, Ch. 3, marked with "lacking serious sources"."
