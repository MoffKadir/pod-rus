 #POD_age.1.t: "Age of Beauty"
 #POD_age.1.desc: "The $pod_kueijin$ refer to this age as the Second Age of the Great Cycle or the Age of Beauty, when the Middle Kingdom and Spirit Courts were still close together. It marks the separation of the Yin and Yang Worlds from the Middle Kingdom, which bore elements of both. It is also the era that sets the Great Cycle in motion. During this Age, the Ebon Dragon and Scarlet Queen were bom, and their interaction and opposition furthered the turning of the Cycle, coalescing matter and spftit-stuff alike. Soon thereafter, the Ebon Dragon and the Scarlet Queen learned to breathe, and as they breathed, the Ten Thousand Things of matter and spirit began to take shape. Where breathed the Dragon, spirits and properties of Yin appeared; where breathed the Queen, spirits and properties of Yang txxik form. Soon, the worlds of matter and spirit had been breathed into existence.\nGods and dragons walked the young, vibrant world, and to them Heaven ordained duties and positions in the Spirit Courts.\nHowever, as the celestial beings gravitated to their specific realms, some escaped the notice and tutelage of the Dragon and the Queen. These beings, deprived of proper instruction, neglected their duties and failed to make obeisance to the will of Heaven. Certain creatures became dualistically opposed to others, while others combined Yin and Yang in unwholesome imbalance. Demons and monsters, greedy devourers of Chi, thus also were born."

 #POD_age.2.t: "Age of Legends"
 #POD_age.2.desc: "The $pod_kueijin$, Hsien and Hengeyokai speak of the Third Age as the Third Age of the Great Cycle, the Age of Legends. It was the mythical prehistory of the Middle Kingdom, when the [Glossary('Wan Xian','game_concept_kuei_jin_desc')] walked among and ruled humanity as benevolent masters. They were the immortal emperors, the demon-slayers, the gods who walked among humanity and guided its progress. At the directive of the Ebon Dragon, the Scarlet Queen and the August Personage itself, the Wan Xian purged the world of the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')]' servants. If a spirit or demon grew unruly, the Wan Xian could drive it from the Middle Kingdom, then report the transgression to its spirit master; if a mortal ruler strayed from the way of Heaven, the Wan Xian could set the mortal aright. As Wan Xian gained in wisdom and completed their tasks, they passed from the world to join die gods, and the Ebon Dragon and Scarlet Queen then selected more Wan Xian to replace them.\n\nThe Third Age ended through the machinations of the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')], who corrupted the Wan Xian to feed on chi. It also marked the end of mythic tradition and the beginning of history as humans understand it today."

 #POD_age.3.t: "Age of Beautiful Sadness"
 #POD_age.3.desc: "The $pod_kueijin$ call this age as the Fourth Age of the Great Cycle or the Age of Beautiful Sadness. It marks the beginning of $pod_kueijin$'s curse and transformation from warriors of Heaven into demonic creatures originating in Yomi. The August Personage turned its face from Middle Kingdom, Spirit Courts and Great Cycle alike. Deprived of supervision, the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] and their demon minions seeped back into the Middle Kingdom. The hengeyokai angered beyond reason by the [Glossary('Wan Xian','game_concept_kuei_jin_desc')]'s depredations, fell upon the humans who had foolishly followed their immortal masters. The Dragon and Queen, ashamed, likewise turned away from their errant children — but not before leaving the secrets of the [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')] hidden in clouds, wind, rain and blood, so that one night the [Glossary('Wan Xian','game_concept_kuei_jin_desc')] might redeem themselves and regain their place in the Cycle.\n\nHuman history begins during this period, and the Kuei-jin trace their vulnerability to sunlight to this time (the Chou Dynasty, specifically). According to scholars, the Fourth Age begins approximately around 900 BCE and ends around 1250-1349 CE (according to the counting of the $pod_kueijin$)."

 #POD_age.4.t: "Age of Darkness"
 #POD_age.4.desc: "To the $pod_kueijin$, the Fifth Age of the Great Cycle is the Age of Darkness.  Driven to madness by the P'o, forced to reanimate corpses and sustain them with stolen life-force, most $pod_kueijin$ endure existences every bit as miserable as those of their Cainite rivals. In fact, for the Hungry Dead, unlife is often worse, for their personal struggles are overlaid with tremendous, collective guilt.\nThe $pod_kueijin$ must now decide whether they should seek to right the Great Cycle, attempt a desperate escape or succumb to their curse as monsters. And their decision must be made soon."

 #POD_age.5.t: "Age of Sorrow"
 #POD_age.5.desc: "The $pod_kueijin$ call the Sixth Age of the Great Cycle as the Age of Sorrow. It is the nadir of the Wheel, where the [Glossary('August Personage of Jade','podgloss.augustpersonageofjade')] steps down from His throne and one of the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] will ascend to become the [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')]. It is the lowest point on the Cycle, which many Kuei-jin believe will usher in a time of apocalyptic disruption, when the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] will rise and rule among the nations. How long the Sixth Age will last is indeterminate, but all are convinced that it is imminent and will be violent. However, most $pod_kueijin$ see the Age of Sorrow as a necessary part of existence before the wheel starts a new cycle, beginning once again as a paradise."
