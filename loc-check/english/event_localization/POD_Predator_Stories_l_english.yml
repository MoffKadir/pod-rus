 POD_predatorstories.1010.desc: "it is rare for the target of a vampiric feeding to be able to fight back. Fangs piercing someone's skin provoke an ecstatic feeling (known as "the kiss") that renders most victims docile. Exceptions always exist obviously be they because of an especially strong willpower or outside intervention breaking the trance.\nTonight this is one of these rare instances, your prospective victim is trying to resist you. While not a real threat to someone of your power, their cries for help could bring the wrong kind of attention."

Turns out your "victim" was prepared for you, likely part of a local band of hunters that studied your feeding habits.\nLuckily you spotted their ambush before the situation could really become dire, leaving you ample time to react. Still, a protracted fight could lead to an exposure of your true nature to a wider audience than you would care for."

 POD_predatorstories.1130.t: "Feeding Frenzy"
 POD_predatorstories.1130.desc: "Feeding is an intensely pleasurable sensation for vampires. The blood is their life and the temptation to take just a little bit more is always there. Even the most well mannered of Caine's children can't always resist their base nature.

 #Victim hires or performs attempted exorcism on vampire
 POD_predatorstories.1170.t: "Demon With Fangs"
 POD_predatorstories.1170.desc: "While most mortals can instinctively understand that you aren't one of them, few can really understand what you are truly are. As such, many resort to the quite broad categorization of "demon"... which means that you are more amused than surprised when you hear that some wannabe exorcists are looking for you. It is of no big concern on its own but there is always the risk that these buffoons would draw the attention of more skilled and dangerous hunters."
 POD_predatorstories.1170.a: "The rumors are harmless."
