 podintroductions.2003.desc: "The first thing to note is that, as a $POD_splat_vampire$, you are immortal... sort of. You won't die of old age or disease, but being put to the torch or decapitated will still end your unlife. As such, succession is a lesser, but still present, concern for you. In the same vein, Marriages can't produce children, so they are mostly a political tool available to a select few religions. \nReligions are a core part of the gameplay, even more than in CK3. Here, it represents the core philosophical tenets of your character, which help him not fall to the Beast. Indeed, the Beast -a literal manifestation of your inner monstrosity- is one of your worst foes, and managing your stress is paramount to not fall prey to it, as it would mean your character has become a feral wight, resulting in his abdication.\nTake notice of your hunger, a core modifier representing your need for blood. Hunger is used for many schemes and powers, and replenish slowly or with active hunting."
 podintroductions.2003.desc_ghouls: "Firstly, it is recommended to only play $POD_splat_ghoul_plural$ and $POD_splat_revenant_plural$ after you have a good grasp of $POD_splat_vampire$ mechanics, as they both use similar ones, but with less possibilities and more difficulties for the 'servants of darkness'. This intro will only talk about specific changes from the mainline vampire mechanics.\nGhouls are immortals but [Glossary('Revenants','game_concept_revenant_desc')] aren't, their lifespan is greatly improved over mortal humans however. Both can have children, which are likely to become [Glossary('Revenants','game_concept_revenant_desc')] (more so if from a [Glossary('Revenant','game_concept_revenant_desc')] couple).\nThey got access to special buildings which are quite powerful, but lack access to some of the more specific vampire ones.\nThey can use [Glossary('Disciplines','game_concept_discipline_desc')] in the same lifestyle way as vampires. There are no $pod_Embrace$, $pod_diablerie$ schemes and the like available to them.\nKeep in mind that, while unnaturally healthy, you aren't immune to diseases like vampires are.\nFinally, remember that this is a substantially harder gameplay style, since you basically are a weaker vampire with few advantages, less mechanics and a lot of new drawbacks."

You can instead choose to invest your time into the [Glossary('Disciplines','game_concept_discipline_desc')], opening the powers of the damned for your use.\nBuildings represent your influence over the mortal populace. Most are capped by a stat like control and you will have to choose how to balance these. Note that major centers of populations, represented by high development duchy capitals are the biggest asset any Prince can dream of.\nWarfare is sensibly altered, with a bigger emphasis on knights. The prowess of your knights can easily overcome a much more numerous foe, especially if mostly composed of levies. As such, be very wary of high prowess hostile Vampires.\nIn a world full of deceit and tricks, intrigue plays a bigger role. There are new schemes to discover, some linked to your powers, and most of the characters have secrets better left untold... or used for blackmail if their religion allows it."

The opposition to this has coalesced into the formation of the Sabbat, vampires revealing in their monstrous nature.

They are the original Immortals of Egypt, the land of black sand and pyramids. Bound together by their shared culture, they continue to work towards Horus's twin goals: vengeance against Set and the defeat of the serpent Apophis.\nNot all Mummies are committed to this fight however. Some instead have chosen to go their separate way despite Horus' disapproval, those have became known as Ishmaelites.\nOne of those 'neutral' Mummies then taught the Spell of Life to Cabirus, a Greek Mage, who founded his own 'dynasty' still hunted to this day by Horus who isn't happy at all about the sacred Spell of Life being given to unbelievers.\nFinally, Set himself never acquired the true Spell of Life but he got close to it, enough so that he created his own twisted version of it. This resulted in the birth of the Bane Mummies, demented mockeries of the true Mummies of Egypt and dedicated to their dark god's bidding."

Keep in mind that tombs can be raided however, costing you precious resources if not defended properly.\n\nMummies can't easily create more of their kind, thus they use their cultists, the Neteru, to accomplish most mundane tasks. Finding more Neteru, even among other supernatural, will be useful if you plan on expanding.\n\nIf they die, Mummies will be judged on various criteria depending on their affiliation. So while truly immortal, dying can still be costly if they are found wanting."

What would you rather I say? You’ll get a different answer from every closet philosopher out there. The fae are made from the dreams of mortals. We’re the children of the Tuatha de Danann. Dana herself created us. They’re probably all true in their own way. The [Glossary('Mythic Age','game_concept_mythic_age_desc')] was just that… mythic. A story changes with the telling and so does our past. The past is reflected in the Now, and time is fluid. Cave paintings were magical. They fixed an event in time.

 podintroductions.2505.desc: "Since the Sundering’s beginning, the world’s connection with the [UmbraGlossary('dreaming')] was slowly wavering. Then, the world changed for the worse. As Banality grew stronger, the fae grew weaker. The cycles of our lives were gradually but inexorably spinning into new courses, and some among the Unseelie Court were determined to do something to draw the Dreaming back to them. They believed that plunging the world into chaos would lessen Banality and make mortals more tractable. After all, they’re more likely to believe in dragons if they see one flatten their house. These dark fae refused the Seelie their ascendance during the light half of the year, and so the mad struggle began. Shocked by this unheard-of breach in tradition, many fae fell into their own Unseelie natures. Bitter winds and cold rains the dark ones brought to bear against a cowering world; dragons and drakes and great wyrms were wakened from centuries-long slumber to once more make the earth wither beneath the shadow of their wings.\nIn the early years of the thirteenth century, the winters grew long and cold and the rains fell with monsoon-like duration. Crops drowned. Roads were reduced to muddy morasses. Famine and cold did their part to fill the graveyards. Warfare’s destruction was pegged on Mongols or squabbles between local kings instead of the Shining Host and nightmares made real. Killing the Dreamers was madness; starving and hopeless peasants cannot dream, and an artist in a hungry land cannot find patronage. Even worse, in such chaos, people looked to the Church, whose hate of the fae was growing. And still the battles raged."

 podintroductions.317.desc: "A scattered cult at best, the Lazarites believe in the wisdom and divinity of the Cappadocian Lazarus and study the secrets of life and death as a means of emulating and serving him. Constancia, the Cappadocian high priestess at Erciyes, considers them heretics for Lazarus’ failure to heed the will of his sire, Cappadocius, and for their belief in resurrection.\nWhen Cappadocius called together his childer for what became known as the Feast of Folly, Lazarus did not respond to the summons. When he found Lazarus, his brother in blood Caias discovered that his erstwhile sibling defied Cappadocius’ will and attacked him for his insolence. While victorious, Lazarus decided to withdraw even more from the world.\nRecently, rumors are spreading that he has been attacked once more by the Cappadocians (Constancia specifically) and fell into $pod_torpor$. In his absence, it's his right hand Angelique that handles the cult."

 podintroductions.318.desc: "Octavio was born in the lands now called Hungary when Rome's legions built Aquincum. As a mortal, he was a shaman who somehow touched upon Kupala's dark heart and became suffused with madness. He took the name Octavio since he firmly believes that eight portents will herald the awakening of Kupala and the demon's ascendancy over the world. Driven even more insane by the centuries spent within the tainted earth of his homeland, he captures mortals (and any Cainites he can) and plays elaborate games with them. Then he sacrifices them to Kupala (whether to aid the demon or bind him, even Octavio does not know).\nHe is hatching a plot toward obtaining apotheosis. In this manner, he hopes to gain sufficient power to oppose Kupala directly. He seeks mortal adulation, creating a cult around himself. Those who worship Octavio calls him Havnor, believing he is an ancient Magyar god. He cares little for the titles of respect they give him, as long as they share their blood and make obeisance. He plans to make his move against Prince Vencel – or perhaps for him. He can so rarely remember exactly what his plans are these nights, when his head is afire with prophesy.\nOctavio hears the voice of the demon inside his head. He knows he will arise someday to claim dominion over the Earth. Eight great signs foretell Kupala's awakening and Octavio tells others what those signs are. Meanwhile, he has decided to become a god so he can fight Kupala, and tries to convince others through holy miracles that he is indeed divine."

 podintroductions.319.desc: "The Apostles of the Third Caine are an offshoot of the Cainite Heresy that broke away from the See of Nod some- time around the year 1000. Its leaders believed that Narses of Venice, then Archbishop of Nod, was too concerned with temporal matters and not enough with the spiritual needs of his flock. Like several of the mortal Catholic monastic orders, the Apostles are a reform movement within their faith. They hope that their austere and simple ways can inspire other Heretics to abandon the indolent See of Nod and join them in preparing the way for the vampiric Messiah to come.\nThe Portuguese branch of this group, led by the Asturian Cainite Balesquida, believed King Sancho of Portugal was the Third Caine. His death in 1211 came as a blow to them, although some of Balesquida’s followers openly wonder whether the king’s death is merely a ruse to pave the way for his eventual return in glory. That they know of no Cainite to have Embraced Sancho only strengthens their belief.\nThis zeal, combined with the current collapse of the mainstream Church of Caine, has made the Apostles a surprisingly powerful faction in nightly Portuguese politics as of late."

Leading a great host, he shall reclaim the Promised Land so that we may return home from our long exile. Taking up the mantle of Dawid, he shall be our king, and we Judges his protectors against the night.\nWhere others look to the future, many among our number look to the past. First Shlomo and then his son, Menahem, sought to free our people here in Amadiya. Much to our sorrow, Shlomo fell in battle while Menahem was brought low through treachery, leaving us to take up their legacy. However, there is debate among us regarding that legacy's nature. Some say that Shlomo claimed the title of Messiah while others point to Menahem. Still others say that the Messiah stands among us today or is yet to come.\nThose within the night use this theological debate to divide us, to turn us against each other, as they have throughout history. If we are to push back the night, we must be unified behind a single legacy, a single vision of the future.\nWith the death of your mentor, Zeviel, during a recent hunt and your ascension to our leader, the time is right to settle this matter.
