 POD_necromancy.200.desc: "When Degulo was first practiced, its necromancer creators celebrated in a long, grim reverie. These nights, Degulo’s efficacy is weighed against the dangers it presents. Where Daemonic Possession focuses on the art of transposing a departed spirit into the empty shell of a corpse, Degulo is the method by which a necromancer consumes a fragment of soul and retains it forever as a part of himself. The process by which a necromancer eats a spirit requires great sacrifice on the part of the practitioner, who must give up a part of himself to allow the dead to move in. Some necromancers are known to strip their bodies of frailty in order to take on the souls of mighty warriors, where others lose knowledge of their own languages to make room for ancient, arcane dialects. At the extreme end, some Harbingers divest themselves of their clan-given powers in exchange for Disci- plines possessed by passed Cainites.\nFirst you will pick a $pod_discipline$ you don't have from the victim's skull..."
