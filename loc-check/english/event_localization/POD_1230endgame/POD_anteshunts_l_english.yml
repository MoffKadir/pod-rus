 POD_anteshuntabsi.1.desc: "The Anarch Revolt is an unprecedented time of crisis... and opportunity. With most clans in disarray, and the Inquisition stopping elders from long range communication, ancient $pod_cainites$ are vulnerable like never before.\nSome of the most vindictive Anarchs are planning daring attacks against the [Glossary('Antediluvians','game_concept_antediluvian_desc')], progenitors of the clans, in the hope of re-enacting Tremere's $pod_diablerie$ of Saulot. Will you try your hand at this endeavor? The potential rewards are attractive but the risks... the risks are beyond imagination. These entities are closer to Gods than mere humans."

The only person to have a clue about it might be Baba Yaga, his wayward childe and the target of his ire for so long. The problem is... she is also hiding.\nTo find her, you can, painfully, look for any information about her yourself or ask her second-in-command, Viktor of the Shadow Curtain, about a potential alliance against Absimilliard.
