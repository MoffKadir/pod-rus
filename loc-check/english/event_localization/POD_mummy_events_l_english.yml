 POD_mummy_resurrection.1.desc: "When they die, Mummies go into a lengthy (and unpleasant) process where their soul is thrown into a spiritual realm named the [UmbraGlossary('pod_realm_tempest')]. There, They slowly return to [UmbraGlossary('earth')]. Additionally, some types of $POD_splat_mummy_plural$ also will be judged.\nShemsu-heru Mummies go to Amenti, the realm of the Egyptian dead to meet with Anubis and the judges of Ma'at while Cabiri Mummies go to Hades where they have to fend on their own in a more hostile environment."
 POD_mummy_resurrection.1.a: "Judge me"

 POD_mummy_resurrection.2.t: "Scales of Ma'at"
 POD_mummy_resurrection.2.desc: "You have been killed, now you find yourself in the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Underworld')], and shall pass a judgment to prove you are worth resurrecting.\nIt starts with waiting for Anubis to locate you, which can be a long and stressful process, before being brought before the judges of Ma'at that will assess whether you worked diligently to further the cause of balance in your last life."

 podmummy.1000.t: "Tomb Raiders!"
 podmummy.1000.desc: "Your tomb holds a large number of sentimental possessions of your past lives... which are seen as priceless treasures to the uncouth modern eye. Tomb raiding has been a tradition as far as the tombs themselves existed and a bane to Mummies' existence, often finding themselves missing key mementos when awakening for a new cycle.\nAs such, they have developed cults and traps to protect what is rightfully theirs from the greedy but sometimes even the most carefully built defenses can be broken by sheer luck by these pesky adventurers."

 podmummy.1000.b: "Time to crush these pesky ants myself."
 podmummy.1000.c: "I have better things to do."

 podmummy.1001.t: "Vampire Tomb Raiders!"
 podmummy.1001.desc: "Vampires have been fascinated by Mummies since they got into contact with one another. This (apparently) more "pure" form of immortality free from the curse of Caine is appealing to them, especially as they see Mummies as "true immortals" as even final death only starts a new cycle for them. As such, it is no surprise that many vampires have been obsessed with trying to uncover the secrets of your kind.\nIt sadly often makes them no different than your usual tomb raider as they see your relics as potential keys to your secrets. Vampires often end up being much more of a threat however because they know what you can do and have access to powers that mortals adventurers can only dream of."
 podmummy.1001.a: "I should make a sunbathed tomb..."
 podmummy.1001.b: "I will show you true immortality!"
 podmummy.1001.c: "I have better things to do."
