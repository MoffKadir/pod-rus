 inquisition_full_support_modifier_desc: "You have the full backing of his Holiness and thus of the Church itself. Glory to God!"
 
 PODask_pope.1.t: "His Holiness: Gregory IX"
 PODask_pope.1.desc: "The Shadow Inquisition is in many ways a direct extension of the Catholic Church with most of its funding and backing coming directly from it. Pope Gregory is a fervent advocate of this effort, to a point where he is considering creating a "public" Inquisition to tackle less supernatural threats in the future. Having the direct ear of such a powerful individual is a boon not be squandered lightly by the burgeoning Shadow Inquisition.\nMany Inquisitors fear that Gregory's successors might not be so keen on supporting your efforts, perhaps due to supernatural interference or simply disinterest (or disbelief of the threat) on their part. If this was to happen, it's likely that the organization as a whole would suffer. Concerned voices among the Inquisitors plan to do as must as they can in the short term, and pray for Gregory's long and healthy life."
 PODask_pope.1.a: "Long live His Holiness!"
 
 PODask_pope.3.t: "White Smoke, White Clouds"
 PODask_pope.3.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nThe cardinals have chosen well this time, and the new Pope is fully supportive of the Shadow Inquisition, using all his considerable leverage to make sure that you will not lack anything that could help you fight the true threat."
 
 PODask_pope.4.t: "White Smoke, Clear Skies"
 PODask_pope.4.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nThe new Pope has chosen to not interfere with the affairs of the Shadow Inquisition in any shape or form. While you would have appreciated a clearer support from Rome, there is at least no defiance against your order. This will have to suffice for now."
 PODask_pope.4.a: "Long live His Holiness."

 inquisition_no_support_modifier: "Papal Ban"
 inquisition_no_support_modifier_desc: "You are not officially part of the Catholic Church anymore. Only a select few high ranking members of the Curia still support you."
 
 PODask_pope.5.t: "White Smoke, Black Clouds"
 PODask_pope.5.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nWorryingly, the new Pope has been horrified when he has been informed of the existence of the Shadow Inquisition. Accusing it of being one of the dirty secrets he wants to get rid off during his tenure, his Holiness has officially withdrawn all support from the Church. This is a dire situation, but there might be a solution: some Cardinals still support your cause and, given proper support from your part, they could still keep the line of communication open between you and the Church."
 PODask_pope.5.a: "Long live His Holiness..."
 PODask_pope.5.b: "We know better."

 PODask_pope.6.t: "White Smoke, Shifting Shadows"
 PODask_pope.6.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nThe new Pope is a man of spiritual leanings, and don't concern himself much with temporal matters such as your organization. It seems that the Cardinals will have an inflated importance during his tenure and this is worrying news to you, as they are often the target of supernatural influence. You could try launching a full scale investigation on them but this would be bound to rustle some feathers."
 PODask_pope.6.a: "Let us target the really corrupt ones."
 PODask_pope.6.b: "Heretics will be purged!"
 PODask_pope.6.effect.success.desc: "A successful investigation!"
 PODask_pope.6.critical.failure.effect.desc: "Waylaid at every turn..."

 PODask_pope.7.t: "White Smoke, White Shadows"
 PODask_pope.7.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nTo help the Shadow Inquisition, the new Pope is planning a diplomatic outreach to others faiths and their own hunter organizations. You are obviously expected to join and help clear any past misunderstandings between them and the Catholic Church to smooth the process. His Holiness being inclined to help, you could also convince him that it would be a futile effort and redirect the funds elsewhere instead."
 PODask_pope.7.a: "A brilliant idea your Holiness."
 PODask_pope.7.b: "These heretics can't be trusted."
 PODask_pope.7.effect.success.desc: "A successful negotiation!"
 PODask_pope.7.critical.failure.effect.desc: "Successful, but costly."

 PODask_pope.8.t: "White Smoke, Golden Winds"
 PODask_pope.8.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nWhile not outright hostile to the Shadow Inquisition, the new Pope is convinced that you are exaggerating the actual threat. As such, he has decreed a massive cut in the funds provided to you, funds that help you set up most of the work you do in the field. You will have to review all your existing process and probably make some difficult cuts if you want to keep going as you are now."
 PODask_pope.8.a: "Time to reorganize."
 PODask_pope.8.b: "Time to cut costs."
 PODask_pope.8.effect.success.desc: "A successful reorganization!"
 PODask_pope.8.critical.failure.effect.desc: "It made things worse..."

 inquisition_disorganized_levies_modifier: "Eager and Inexperienced"
 inquisition_disorganized_levies_modifier_desc: "Many new recruits are joining the good fight. Their sheer number and complete inexperience are causing issues however."
 
 PODask_pope.9.t: "White Smoke, Blood Winds"
 PODask_pope.9.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nThe new Pope is eager to help the Shadow Inquisition and has as such issued a call for all able youths to join your ranks without notifying you first. While certainly well intended, this gesture has caused quite the disorganization in your ranks as those new recruits are very far from the standards you are expecting of champions of the Inquisition. This will take some effort to sort out."
 PODask_pope.9.a: "Time to reorganize."
 PODask_pope.9.b: "Just accept everyone and deal with it later."

 PODask_pope.10.t: "White Smoke, White Winds"
 PODask_pope.10.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nWhile not dismissing the use of the Shadow Inquisition, the new Pope is concerned about the morality of some actions undertaken in his name. An astute theologian, he has asked to speak with you to help the both of you assess if the results are really worth the soul threatening cost. You are obviously convinced that the answer is yes, but making his Holiness agree to that might be more difficult."
 PODask_pope.10.a: "Time to debate."
 PODask_pope.10.b: "His Holiness is right, obviously."
 PODask_pope.10.effect.success.desc: "His Holiness agrees!"
 PODask_pope.10.critical.failure.effect.desc: "Am I truly doomed?"

 PODask_pope.11.t: "White Smoke, White Fog"
 PODask_pope.11.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nThe new Pope isn't arguing the importance of the Shadow Inquisition but is concerned about the public image it might give him. After all, your organization isn't under direct supervision and could go off the rails at any time. As the repercussions for the Church would be dire, his Holiness asks of you to sever most of your ties with him. This would mean that the Shadow Inquisition would retreat even more behind the curtain, which can be a double edged sword."
 PODask_pope.11.a: "His Holiness has spoken."
 PODask_pope.11.b: "We need those Church ties!"

 PODask_pope.12.t: "White Smoke, Clouded Skies"
 PODask_pope.12.desc: "His Holiness passed away recently, leaving the esteemed cardinals to make their choice for the next occupant of the seat of St-Peter. This is an event followed closely by the Shadow Inquisition, not only for questions of Christian devotion, but also because the support of the Pope is paramount to the long term health of the organization.\nThankfully, the new Pope is supportive of the Shadow Inquisition although he seems especially fond of your specific order. Accepting the numerous titles and other show of praise that he is trying to bestow would certainly reflect well on your people, but less so on your own person."
 PODask_pope.12.a: "His Holiness flatters us."
 PODask_pope.12.b: "It is a team effort."

 PODask_pope.30.t: "The Papal Legate"
 PODask_pope.30.desc.exco: "It was bound to happen.\nDespite your best efforts to hide it, the Papal Legate sent by the new Pope to assess your order was quick to hear the rumors of your clearly ungodly powers and resilience. He deflected your attempts to "convince" him otherwise and was quick to flee your camp as quickly as he has arrived.\nThe letter from Rome come soon after and it is not a surprise. You have been excommunicated, you and your order stripped of any form of support by the Church. While you are free to continue doing what you once did (as Rome doesn't seem intent on hunting you down, for now at least), your existence has suddenly become a lot more complicated."
 PODask_pope.30.desc.witch: "It was bound to happen.\nDespite your best efforts to hide it, the Papal Legate sent by the new Pope to assess your order was quick to hear the rumors of your clearly ungodly powers and resilience. Your conversation to convince him that you are using these powers for the good of Christendom was tense to say the least. It is clear that your credit with the Church has dwindled significantly following that event. Still, you managed to avoid a more drastic threat, such as excommunication, meaning you can continue your work as usual... if under more scrutiny from Rome."
 PODask_pope.30.desc: "The Papal Legate sent by the new Pope to assess your holy order has recently departed. It has been a pleasant visit all things considered. His Holiness's commitment to help the Shadow Inquisition as much as he can was reaffirmed by the envoy. It seems, for the time being at least, that the Curia will support your efforts in full. A welcome prospect."
 PODask_pope.30.a: "I don't need the Church to save Christendom."
 inquisition_excommunicated_tt: "This Papal Ban means you lost [curia_support|E] and access to most Shadow Inquisition Men at Arms. You can regain [curia_support|E] after the next Papal election if your character isn't excommunicated at that point (for example because you let your heir take over)."
 PODask_pope.30.b: "My powers aren't from the Devil!... probably"
 
 PODask_pope.40.desc: "The Papal Legate that arrived with the news of a new Pope was not really interested in the minutia of your organization. Following the new protocol from Rome, he just quickly checked that nothing obviously heretical was going on before taking his leave. It seems you will have very little supervision from the Curia during this Pope's reign."
 
 PODask_pope.50.desc: "The Papal Legate sent by the new Pope to "review" your order is almost openly hostile, believing all this "Shadow Inquisition nonsense" to be a complete waste of times and resources. He is criticizing every little thing and you have the impression that he would cut your order loose from Rome if he could do it on his own.\nIn any case, he is clearly trying to get a rise out of you, probably hoping that you will make a public mistake that will allow him to make an even more damning report to the Vatican."
 PODask_pope.50.a: "Give him what for!"
 PODask_pope.50.b: "Grit your teeth."
 
 PODask_pope.60.desc: "The Papal Legate sent by Rome to check on your order is a shifty sort that has been arousing your suspicion. WIth tne new Pope being spiritually minded, it is sadly quite likely that a Cardinal in the pocket of the hellspawn is pulling the strings of this legate, likely to present a damning report to cut the much needed support you receive.\nActing directly against the man would be unwise as he is still an agent of the Vatican after all, but you could bypass him. You have penned a letter detailing the spiritual importance of your holy mission to his Holiness, hopefully pushing him to ignore the undoubtedly compromised report soon coming to his desk."
 PODask_pope.60.a: "We wage war for the very soul of humanity."
 PODask_pope.60.effect.success.desc: "You are heard."
 PODask_pope.60.critical.failure.effect.desc: "Deaf ears..."
  
 PODask_pope.70.desc: "Some of the new Pope outreach to other faiths has already paid off. You are surprised to see a Papal legate coming to your camp with a group of Orthodox hunters. While there is some suspicion of these schismatics among your people, you quickly rebuke them. These are fellow warriors of Christ coming from far away, they should be welcomed as honored guests and nothing else. Thanks to your effort, the Akritai quickly set up their own camp not far from your own and pledge their swords to your cause to the satisfaction of the Papal legate."
 PODask_pope.70.a: "A welcome sight."
   
 PODask_pope.80.desc: "The Papal legate sent to oversee the "restructuring" of your order is pleased to see you at least making some efforts to cut costs. He assures you that Rome isn't planning to remove its support to your order but is mainly concerned by some recent treasury issues. He lets you know in passing that, if you have still some to spare, a suitable donation to the current effort would certainly make the Curia values your holy mission even more than it already does."
 PODask_pope.80.a: "A "donation", I see..."
 PODask_pope.80.b: "Our treasury is stretched thin."

 PODask_pope.90.desc: "The new recruits sent by the Pope have arrived with a Papal legate eager to see you transform these untrained youths into proper inquisitors. Which, as you fully know, would take a lot of time, a lot of efforts and quite a toll on your provisions as Rome clearly misjudged how long this whole process would take. Judging by the legate's eagerness however, failing to at least make an effort would reflect quite poorly on your organization."
 PODask_pope.90.a: "Maybe I should ask them to fast for their training?"
 PODask_pope.90.b: "We need quality not quantity."

 PODask_pope.100.desc: "The Papal legate sent by the new Pope to review your order has been an amicable presence in your camp. Besides looking for obvious signs of heretical behavior, he has been more concerned with discussing the finer points of theology with someone more "active on the front lines" like you. While you are far from having all the answers (you know more about killing the hellspawns than understanding them), it at least makes for a pleasant and inconsequential visit." 
 PODask_pope.100.a: "They believe that biblical Cain was their progenitor."

 PODask_pope.110.desc: "The Papal legate sent by the new Pope has sadly confirmed the Vatican's new policy. Support for your organization is likely to dry down in the coming years as his Holiness wants to avoid the possibility of a scandal. Still, you had contingencies in place with many Cardinals looking to help you in a less official capacity. You ensure your people that this is a setback but far from the end of your order." 
 PODask_pope.110.a: "We will endure."

 PODask_pope.120.desc: "The new Pope's favorable stance on your order has already paid dividends. The Papal legate sent by his Holiness is quick to propose a tighter relationship with the Curia for your organization specifically. While this has obvious advantages, this favoritism has already put a strain on your relationship with other Inquisitor orders that question your character and what you had to do to earn these favors. Refusing them would be a show of goodwill towards your allies." 
 PODask_pope.120.a: "We deserve this privileged relationship."
 PODask_pope.120.b: "We have all the support we need."

While they haven't excommunicated you, you won't be officially part of the Shadow Inquisition for the time being.\nThere is hope however, Leopold von Murnau, the informal coordinator of the Inquisition, has been mightily impressed by your drive. He has put you in contact with the Knights of St. Helena, an order of lady knights created during the Crusades and also sidelined by the Church.\nAfter meeting with their grandmistress Perinne and convincing her of the importance of your mission against the true (supernatural) Enemy, she is willing to join your nascent order. Having these martially gifted women at your side would be a great boon but you are worried that Rome might be even more angry to see two spurious orders join forces together without a Papal blessing."
