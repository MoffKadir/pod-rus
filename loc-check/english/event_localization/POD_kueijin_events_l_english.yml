 podkueijin.1.t: "A Worthy Successor?"
 podkueijin.1.desc: "Your servants have returned with what promising [Glossary('Hungry Dead','game_concept_kuei_jin_desc')] they could find. Some of them are more talented than others, but will also require more leverage to bind to your service. It will still be a gamble anyway, you don't have time to review them personally before making your choice, since the sudden attention you gave them will attract the notice of rivals."

 podkueijin.10.t: "Crisis of [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')]"
 podkueijin.10.desc: "The choice of [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')] doesn't have to be permanent. Most $pod_kueijin$ start down one path, then abandon it in favor of other destinies. Sometimes, they even return to their original purpose. Immortality offers a greater range of choices than any mortal lifetime, and those choices are never as obvious as they might seem.\nEither way, there is a cost. All [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')] levels are surrendered; the Kuei-jin begins a new Way and lose any status or benefits granted by her old rank. If she's within the first 50 years of her unlife, such failings are to be expected; she can anticipate being scolded, but not badly shamed."
 podkueijin.10.a: "Follow your instinct."
 podkueijin.10.b: "I am perfectly fine..."

 #podkueijin.100.desc: "Wan-Kuei have been sent back to fulfill their karmic purpose, and it is imperative that they discover what that purpose is. Each and every Wan-Kuei learns to follow a [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')], a way of unlife whereby the Wan-Kuei seeks to discover her purpose in the Great Cycle. Through the following of a [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')], a Wan-Kuei learns to channel Chi, understand her undead nature and re-attune herself to the karmic wheel."

 podkueijin.110.t: "Yin Yang"
 podkueijin.110.desc: "Yin-aspected Wan-Kuei are reservoirs for negative, death oriented energy. They tend to be calm, rational and cruel.\nYang-aspected Wan-Kuei, by contrast, greedily consume life energy. They are passionate creatures, attuned to mortals and the emotions.\nSome Wan-Kuei are creatures of Balance, their bodies maintaining life and death energies in equilibrium."
 podkueijin.110.a: "I prefer Yin." 
 podkueijin.110.b: "I prefer to be Balanced." 
 podkueijin.110.c: "I prefer Yang." 
 
 podkueijin.120.t: "Chi"
 podkueijin.120.desc: "This [Glossary('Wheel of Ages','podgloss.wheelofages')] turns by the interactions of Yin and Yang, represented by the divine Ebon Dragon and Scarlet Queen. Energies of creation permeate the world, flowing to and from the Yin and [Glossary('Yang World','game_concept_yang_world_desc')]s. Called Chi, this energy flows through and among all the Ten Thousand Things.\n\nLike Kindred, Wan-Kuei suffer from hunger. When a Wan-Kuei has five or fewer Chi points (of either sort) in their body, they becomes hungry.\n\nA Wan-Kuei's Chi Virtues indicate how much of a given type of Chi the Wan-Kuei may safely channel through her body. The Wan-Kuei is easily capable of ingesting more temporary Chi than her Chi Virtues indicate (a permanent imbalance allows to ingest more Chi of that type without ill effects). However, a Wan-Kuei who abuses this practice runs the risk of an imbalance - a dangerous 'overdose' of Chi. Wan-Kuei with none of a particular type of Chi in her body is thrown in an automatic state of temporary imbalance too."
 podkueijin.120.a: "Here is my Chi."

 podkueijin.200.desc: "[GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] must regulate their Chi intake carefully, lest they suffer from Chi imbalance. An imbalance of Yin Chi often leads to the vampire becoming more corpselike and inhuman over time; conversely, an imbalance of Yang can lead to the outbreak of various deadly and exceedingly contagious vampiric diseases."
 podkueijin.200.a: "Punishment for excessive focus on the Self." 
 podkueijin.200.a.tt: "Your closeness to Yin made you more ugly and a potential target of witch hunters."

 podkueijin.200.c: "I will focus Yin Chi into my body to become a little more balanced." 

 podkueijin.201.t: "Ch'ing Shih"
 podkueijin.201.desc: "Ch'ing Shih are outright monstrosities and cannot pass as ordinary humans in any way. The Wan-Kuei's flesh turns a sickly gray, while bones turn jet black. Skin wrinkles and compresses around bones. Fangs grow long and drip venom, and black spikes jut from back, joints, and rib cage. Entire body glows phosphorescently and sparks with Yin energy."
 podkueijin.201.a: "I am a monster among monsters."
 
 # Chi mechanic event
 
 podkueijin.210.t: "Lost control"
 podkueijin.210.desc: "You are out of Chi, maybe because you are a Yang Wan-Kuei and feel the hunger more, or maybe you spent all of your Chi and can't use the other aspect Chi because you don't master the flow. So you lost control and rampaged into a crowd to acquire some Chi..."
 podkueijin.210.a: "What a shame."

 podkueijin.211.t: "Lack of Chi"
 podkueijin.211.desc: "A [Glossary('Wan Kuei','game_concept_kuei_jin_desc')] with no Chi in their body begins to crumble and rot. Each time you must expend Chi (to activate a $pod_discipline$ or merely animate your corpse), you lose Health instead, until your dual soul flees the body and your existence as a Rising Dead ends."

While they are supposed to move on to Heaven (and many indeed do), the few mentioned stay in the Middle Kingdom by choice. This is especially true of the Devil Tigers, whose [Glossary('Arhats','podgloss.arhat')] are waiting for the [Glossary('Sixth Age','game_concept_sixth_age_desc')] to arrive..."

 podkueijin.300.desc: "You call your servants to search information about chih-mei (recently returned $pod_kueijin$) around your domain, and you have prepared the necessary material for the ritual that makes them come back to their senses. You can specify more requirements to get more involved in the process, but the more specific you are, the more costly it will be.\nFirst, do you want someone returned from [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')] recently and who took the second breath? This is the usual and much more common choice. But you could also ask for some [GetTrait('shih').GetName( GetPlayer )] who lost all humanity and awakened their P'o.
