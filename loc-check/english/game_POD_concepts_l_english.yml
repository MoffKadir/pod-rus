At the same time, the Lasombras plunge into the abyss for arcane evocations. It is said that blood magic has the power to do almost anything - and while these claims usually come from either practitioner wishing to create a frightsome picture or victims of curses and fireballs, it is indeed true that blood sorcery grants access to myriad spells and abilities that one may consider...

If a ghost bound to you possesses a victim, the target shall likewise be bound to you. Stages of possession: \n 1. In stage one, the victim gains some of the wraith's prowess on top of their own, and the necromancer and wraith gain influence over the victim. \n 2. Stage two imparts some of the Wraith's skills upon the victim, giving them a part of the ghost's stats. The necromancer gains more control over the victim. In addition, the personalities of the wraith and victim begin to meld together. \n 3. In stage three, the possession is complete, and the wraith's personality overwhelms the target. The Victim is enthralled by the wraith and gains more of its skills as the ghost acts through them. The necromancer's control grows even further."

Initiates of the discipline can use it to move and manipulate shadows to their advantage, while masters can give shadows form, substance, and a semblance of life. The nature of the source of this power causes no end of disagreement among Lasombra. The most ancient elders of the $pod_clan$ claim that the darkness is itself a primal entity, equal and opposite to the force of creation that bears the world into being. Influenced by Zoroastrianism, the eldest usually call this dark force Ahriman. Other Lasombra believe that Obtenebration draws its power from a realm of shadow rather than an entity. Lasombra who look to one of the Abrahamic faiths might call it Hell, while an adherent of the ancient Greek or Roman gods might call it Tartarus. Whatever its origin, Obtenebration is wholly unnerving to those who see it in use. It evokes terror in animals or mortals who see the $pod_discipline$ in use. Even $pod_cainites$, whose very existence defies explanation, tend to see Obtenebration as an affront against the laws of nature."

Revenants can drink the blood of a vampire, but unlike a ghoul they do not need to do so, as they can produce their own vitae, which also retards their aging.\nUnlike their masters, and despite their name, revenants are living creatures.

Islam considers Jerusalem as Muhammad's destination during his Night Journey and as the first Qibla.\n\nThe city variants are based on the balance of political influence between the 3 faiths, a balance which remains when the city is conquered. Keep in mind that as a Christian ruler, you may find it expensive to increase Christian influence after conquering the city from a Muslim ruler. There are 4 versions of the city:\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$Christian Jerusalem: Available to followers of $pod_christian_derived_faiths$. Expand the power of 5 crusader orders which all improve or are improved by your knights.\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$Muslim Jerusalem: Available to followers of $pod_muslim_derived_faiths$. Renovate and consecrate important sites to increase your income and ability to eliminate the invading crusaders.\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$Jewish Jerusalem: Available to followers of $pod_jewish_derived_faiths$. Rebuild Jerusalem's ancient monuments to get a well-rounded set of buildings.\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$Divided Jerusalem: Available to everyone else. Build up each of the Quarters to unlock some of the benefits a more specialized Jerusalem might see while maintaining the balance of power, using the graph in the Shift Balance [decision|E] to monitor it.\n\nIn addition to different buildings, Jerusalem offers some $pod_jerusalem_unique_decisions$ involving the nearby Pit."
