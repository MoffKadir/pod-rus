 tariqelsama_adherent: "el-Sama"
 tariqelsama_adherent_plural: "el-Sama"
 tariqelsama_desc: "A follower of the Tariq el-Sama clings to the revelations of the Prophet and counterbalances the raging of the Beast with nightly prayer and unshakeable faith. He does not resist the Beast when it stirs, but allows it a moderate release, reining it in when the urges threaten to take control entirely. The challenge is to keep the balance and allow them only in moderation, for evil lies in excess."

 tariqelbedouin_adherent: "Tribesman"
 tariqelbedouin_adherent_plural: "Tribesmen"
 tariqelbedouin_desc: "A Muslim vampire follows this Tariq because he believes that the indolence and seductive luxuries of palaces and cities weakens an individual's self-discipline and moral courage. Rather than suffer the countless distractions of a nightly existence filled with myriad entertainments, the vampire seeks a harder, more desperate existence, emptying his mind of all save the moment-to-moment challenges posed by the wilderness."

Although not fully accepted by most Ashirra sects, the Tariq el-A'Tham is still tolerated and its adherents are free to pursue knowledge as long as it does not harm mortals."
