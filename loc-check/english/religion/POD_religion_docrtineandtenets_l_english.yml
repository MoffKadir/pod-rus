 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_strict_name: "Strict Masquerade"

 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_strict_desc: "The Silence of Blood is strictly enforced. Many kindred chafe under such draconian enforcement.\n\nMake not friends among the Poets, they will sing too much of you.\n\nBe not known. Seek shadows.\n\nLet not the priest, poet, or peasant see you feed. Not none of them will leave it be.\n\nWhen the Cross has a point, find your safety."

 doctrine_werewolf_veil_should_not_lifted_name: "Should Not Be Lifted"
 doctrine_vampirethemasquerade_lax_desc: "Enforcement of the Silence of Blood is lax. While Kindred make efforts to conceal their existence, they also sometimes make terrible mistakes that are not punished by their elders."
 doctrine_werewolf_veil_should_not_lifted_desc: "The Veil is poetic term for the false assumption that the supernatural does not exist, which the Delirium reinforces. The Veil was formally instituted through the Concord of nine thousand years ago, which ended the Impergium. The Litany states clearly that 'The Veil Shall Not Be Lifted'. Delirium helps in keeping the Veil in place. Harming or rending the Veil means a great loss of honor among the Garou, while repairing the Veil means the opposite. In practice, the Delirium does most of the work and Garou largely need not trouble themselves about. Some tribes see it more as a guideline than a strict rule to be enforced."

The Veil was formally instituted through the Concord of nine thousand years ago, which ended the Impergium. The Litany states clearly that 'The Veil Shall Not Be Lifted'. Delirium helps in keeping the Veil in place. Harming or rending the Veil means a great loss of honor among the Garou, while repairing the Veil means the opposite. Some werewolves find that the Veil is an obsolete idea that no longer matters. Some even actively work to bring down the Veil so that werewolves can once again reinstate the Impergium and openly terrorize all humanity."
