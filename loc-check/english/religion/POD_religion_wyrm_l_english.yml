 wyrm_religion_desc: "The Wyrm is one of the higher Celestines. The Wyrm's purpose is the cleansing and rectification of Creation, furthering its descent into Entropy. He achieves this by eliminating that which the Wyld creates and the Weaver structures.\nWith the advent of humanity, the Wyrm was progressively constrained until he was driven mad, hellbent on destroying everything. Consequently, the Wyrm is now a spirit of destruction, chaos, darkness, and corruption, with its dark servants infesting the lands."

 cluithi_desc: "Within the Black Spiral tribe, however, one Camp has done its best to preserve the White Howler heritage. Cluithi still prowl the most desolate moors and forests of Scotland, imitating the appearance of their ancestors had centuries ago. They rend their clothing, proudly smear themselves with blue body paint and display Pictish tattoos. The rulers of this camp also have an elitist bent, considering themselves the nobility of the tribe. The Camp's name is a reference to the original rulers of the Pictish Kingdoms. Many Cluithi see themselves as the truest children of Cluid, the hero who first led the Picts to Caledonia."

They preach self-indulgence, claiming that the dying corpse of the world is now theirs to rule over and treat as they like. The triumphant champions of the Corrupter they claim indulging their own base instincts is categorically worship of the Wyrm. Princes of Ruin regard the more traditional Black Spiral Dancers as rustics and religious fanatics; violence between the two philosophies is common."

This grants them insight and power indirectly, allowing them to develop and direct a Pit that has been bonded to the surrounding landscape. They serve as shamans, risking thralldom and insanity to commune with unthinkable spirits and gain insight directly."

 maneaters_adherent_plural: "Man-eaters"
 maneaters_desc: "This Bone Gnawer camp gains power by breaching the tenet of the Litany that forbids cannibalism of human flesh. Most of this camp's 'converts' were Garou who had succumbed to frenzy too often. They are few today and many of the remaining have allied with the similar Eaters of the Dead camp among the Silent Striders.\nThe occasional ghoulish tale of ravenous werewolves also gives credence to the existence of the Maneaters — after all, in times of hunger, it's all too tempting for a Gnawer to feed himself and remove a surplus hungry mouth or three at the same time."

Since the unknown is the playground of fear, no true Mask ever reveals their membership in the camp to outsiders, save for those who are targeted for indoctrination into their numbers."

Consume the brain of your enemy and learn all of his secrets: a vile but useful ritual. All who consume the flesh of others slowly go insane and reek of the Wyrm's stench however. Some even develop an addiction to fresh brains, and will kill innocent and guilty alike in order to feast."

 boli_zouhisze_desc: "A Chinese offshoot of the Warders of Men that split sometime before 2000 BCE, though they retained certain aspects of their parent tribe's culture, such as appreciation for human culture and veneration of the spirit Cockroach. The latter caused the native $glossary_fera$ of China to shun the Boli Zouhisze and exclude them from the Beast Courts, because insect imagery is heavily associated with the Wyrm among the Hengeyokai."

 hellcats_desc: "When the Black Spiral Dancers attacked the annual moot of the Ceilican Bastet in Scotland, they forced some of them in the [UmbraGlossary('black_spiral_labyrinth')] in order to turn them to the Wyrm. Those who survived became the Hellcats, their usual genuine madness turned into self-destructing and mindless aggression. Awaiting the Apocalypse to honor their Dark Father, these tainted creatures bring with them their potent links to the illusionary gifts of the Fae and various Wyrm-fetishes they constructed with Bastet-like curiosity."
