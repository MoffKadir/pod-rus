The name translates roughly to "thunderbolt".

It is said to be wondrous to behold, cast in a bluish silver with ancient runes encircling the lip of the cup.If the cup is filled, and the water spilled on the ground as offering to the fair folk, the chalice will bring rain before the next moon rises.

When swung in battle, the sword sings a dirge for the enemies of its wielder. Every enemy felled in battle by the Sword of Madog Cynydd renders up to his slayer whatever remained of his natural life span. Thus, slaying one young man with the Sword of Madog Cynydd could extend the sword-wielder's life by a good forty years.

If a mage fills the cauldron with rocks, a stone elemental will emerge to fight for him.

The fae crafted a beautiful amulet and gave it to one of the queen's courtesans as a gift for his mistress. The queen loved the intricately woven silver necklace and clasped it around her neck. When next she placed a foot on the ground outside her home, her legs rooted themselves into the soil and her body and arms became the trunk and branches of a tree.

Such hammers have been known to shatter armor and bones, rupture internal organs, splinter large oaken doors, and even bring down stone towers."

 artifact_sword_of_drowning_description: "Crafted during the War of Seasons, these weapons contain water sprites or inanimae who either gave up their freedom for the cause or were bound forcibly against their wills.

 artifact_gray_sword_name: "Gray Sword"
 artifact_gray_sword_description: "The Gray Sword, though obviously chimerical, has no personality or adornment and appears as a mundane broadsword with a simple hilt and a flat, unmarked blade.

He hoped to save and restore it so that it could again be used as a weapon against the Tuatha de Danaan and their get. The eye has been dormant for centuries, however, but with the coming of the Red Star visible in the [UmbraGlossary('dreaming')] that the fae call the Eye of Balor, the Royal Guardians have bathed the eye in its light in a protected spot.

By taking a few drops of blood from the types of vampires known as madmen when they evidence their full-blown madness or Toreadors while they are engaged in some artistic pursuit, the Masters create what is called Blood Dross. The blood is stored in tiny rounded vials made of crystallized sugar, which are then coated with as lightly harder shell to hold in the resulting liquid. Several beads can be stored together in a protective box for up to a month without losing their potency."

In response, the craftsmen of House Balor have been constructing a return blow for whomever rules the Seelie when war comes. Known as the Steaming Spear of Vengeance, it uses a spearhead similar to Balor's bane. Wound up with powerful enchantments, the spear is filled with anger that makes it a blood-seeker. "Vengeance" is so powerful that its head must be constantly immersed in water because it melts whatever it touches and its shaft must be kept chained to a manacle sunk deep in stone to prevent it from flying off in search of prey."

Those caught in the mist experience terror in their hearts and even the bravest knights and honorable opponents flee in a panic, often dropping their weapons or anything else they are carrying in their haste to get away. The drawback is that if the wind changes, the ones using the cauldron could be caught in the backlash."

 artifact_edanns_harp_description: "#bold You can auto replenish an extra Glamour every month.#!\nThis ancient wooden harp has a large crack running through it, strings that look like little more than frayed threads, and is in such poor repair that it would only bring a few dollars to someone interested in Celtic history. To enchanted eyes, however, the harp, though ancient and cracked, is inlaid with gold and has silvered strings that appear as fine and fragile as shining hair. No one of the House knows if this is really the harp of Edann, the bard who stole Leanhaun's heart, or a lovingly made copy, but the strong enchantments on it make it a treasure of the house."

 artifact_berserker_armor_name: "Berserker Armor"
 artifact_berserker_armor_description: "This ornate armor shields those who wear it from all attacks with weapons and allows them to fight beyond their regular capacity.

 artifact_havens_compass_name: "Haven's Compass"
 artifact_havens_compass_description: "This treasure usually comes in the form of an antique compass. Rather than pointing northward, it homes in on the closest active freehold or glade. Useful for explorers and wanderers in need of "any port in a storm," the compass doesn't distinguish between the hold of a Seelie motley and that of an Unseelie commoner-hating lord. Since some freeholders keep their homes hidden, they may not look too kindly on the owner of this treasure."

 artifact_bane_dagger_name: "Bane Dagger"
 artifact_bane_dagger_description: "This nasty weapon is designed for assassination, and as such has been officially proscribed. The dagger has a small compartment in the hilt. When a part of the intended victim is placed in the compartment (a strand of hair, an eyelash, or a drop of blood), the blade becomes attuned to that person, and can never be reattuned. Once the target has been killed, the blade begins to corrode, disappearing in less than an hour."

The Glamour it focuses may "leak," causing the one closest to it to have vivid dreams they always remember on waking. Its greatest ability, though, is the power to shape dreamstuff. A skilled Dreamcrafter can create chimerical creatures of immense power, fold the Dreaming in on itself to create pocket realms, or build a trod or gateway where there was none before. The untested rumor is that it could even find and open the way to [UmbraGlossary('arcadia')]."

 artifact_trail_dust_description: "A useful treasure, Trail Dust always comes in a small, weathered-looking leather pouch adorned with an ancient symbol meaning "trail." Inside is a small quantity of dirt or sand appropriate to the are the Elegbara is traveling in. When activated with a point of Glamour and sprinkled across the owner's bare feet, he or she immediately gains a detailed geographic map and directional knowledge of the surrounding area roughly the same as a native twice their age would know."
 artifact_blessed_opa_name: "Blessed Opa"
 artifact_blessed_opa_description: "The opa is the traditional weapon of the Elegbara. Similar to a quarterstaff, it is usually intricately carved and adorned with luck charms and souvenirs their owners have picked up on their journeys. Most are hardened by firing or by Cantrips and are as durable as metal and so able to be used in combat against edged weapons without fear of breaking. They are valued for both their beauty and utility."
 artifact_basilisk_stone_name: "Basilisk Stone"
 artifact_basilisk_stone_description: "Unfortunately, most people don't appreciate Nocker speech habits and while the nockers may rail against such harsh judgements, even they understand there are times when they need to shut up and that can be difficult to do. A Basilisk Stone is, therefore, invaluable while at court or when trying to hold down a job in the mundane world. Although Blistertongue Jill shattered the first and greatest of these treasures, the shards of the original still hold some of Byzamedas' old magic."
 artifact_goblin_lantern_name: "Goblin Lantern"
 artifact_goblin_lantern_description: "This kind of lantern is common in nocker mines. It casts two types of light. The first is visible to all Kithain but with the turn of a knob, a nocker can make it visible only to other nockers."
 artifact_goblin_parchment_name: "Goblin Parchment"
 artifact_goblin_parchment_description: "Goblin Parchment is the preferred medium of nobles and nockers for sending secret messages, especially threats. Writing on Goblin Parchment is only visible to the intended recipient and the paper burns up immediately after it is read. It also resists all attempts to copy the information on it, even by other nockers or Sluagh Wordspiders."
 artifact_goblin_shoes_name: "Goblin Shoes"
 artifact_goblin_shoes_description: "Nockers make these shoes from the skin of a white, subterranean worm chimera. They can stretch over almost any size foot and render the wearer's footsteps almost completely inaudible."
 artifact_razor_claws_name: "Razor Claws"
 artifact_razor_claws_description: "Razor Claws are a regular best-seller among Redcaps. These special gloves hide small, cruelly carved blades that extend beyond the knuckles that can be extended by pressing a stud hidden in the palm of the glove."
 artifact_goblin_bow_name: "Goblin Bow"
 artifact_goblin_bow_description: "This is a multi-shot crossbow that carries six bolts in a metal clip. The bow advances the clip with each shot and so allows the user to make multiple shots without having to stop and reload."
 artifact_goblin_cloak_name: "Goblin Cloak"
 artifact_goblin_cloak_description: "Black crystals are woven into goblin cloaks to bend light around the wearer."
 artifact_pendulum_name: "Pendulum"
 artifact_pendulum_description: "This treasure is a small, hollow metal ball connected to a silver chain. By putting any kind of metal inside the ball, the pendulum will lead the user to the nearest deposit of that material. If none is in the area, the user can dowse over a map and the pendulum will circle over the nearest deposit's general area."
 artifact_universal_solvent_name: "Universal Solvent"
 artifact_universal_solvent_description: "Universal Solvent is a result of Nocker investigation into chimerical alchemy and is the greatest (and among the rarest) products of this science. The solvent is a binary compound; the alchemist must keep its parts in two separate bottles (one Black, one White, usually). When the nocker mixes the two components, a dense cloud of pure Banality pours forth, dissolving every chimerical object in its path, including changelings in their fae mien."
 artifact_magical_crumbs_name: "Magical Crumbs"
 artifact_magical_crumbs_description: "A common treasure among pooka, Magical Crumbs reportedly come from the Black Forest in Germany. Gathered up off the ground along a special path, they have the ability to lead a pooka back home if they should stray. Most pooka own two of them: one to leave at the point of departure and one carried with the pooka to serve as the scent. So long as the pooka remembers to leave one at home and doesn’t lose the one they're carrying, they can eventually sniff their way back. Obviously, they could also be shared between friends so the pooka could find the other person in case they were separated."
 artifact_cat_boots_name: "Cat Boots"
 artifact_cat_boots_description: "Many lifetimes ago, or so the story goes, a shoemaker in London saved the life of a cat after it had run afoul of a large dog. The shoemaker nursed the cat back to health and in exchange, the cat, who was a pooka, helped the shoemaker. For a year and a day, every set of boots that the shoemaker created had the special quality that they made other people ignore the wearer’s presence. Changelings came from around the world to purchase the boots and the shoemaker prospered, retired rich and happy, and eventually the pooka went on his way."
 artifact_balthazars_bracelets_name: "Balthazar's Bracelets"
 artifact_balthazars_bracelets_description: "If nothing else, these matching bracelets have a delicate beauty that makes them a special addition to the stash of any pooka who likes pretty, shiny things. However, they also have a very unique benefit when worn. When placed on the wrists, they tighten of their own accord to fit smoothly over the changeling’s forearms, swirling up from wrist to elbow. If the faerie knocks once on the bracelets, they meld to the skin and become ebony tattoos that will shape-shift with the pooka when he changes to his animal mien. In that form, the tattoos simply resemble markings on the animal’s skin."
 artifact_cleopatras_wings_name: "Cleopatra's Wings"
 artifact_cleopatras_wings_description: "This handsome, one-of-a-kind choker has a butterfly pendant hanging from a wide gold band that fits around the neck. Made of amber, the butterfly’s wings blush scarlet near the golden body and lighten to a warm orange near the tips. The changeling that wears the necklace gains the ability to fly in a manner similar to that of the Wind Runner cantrip. A pair of shimmery, intangible wings appear at the faerie’s back. The wings themselves have no substance and cannot be damaged. They disappear as soon as the changeling removes the choker."
 artifact_osiris_flail_name: "Osiris' Flail"
 artifact_osiris_flail_description: "The first pharaoh of ancient Egypt, Osiris, kept two symbols of power. One of these, his flail, is depicted on the sarcophagi of many of the pharaohs that followed in his footsteps. It is usually shown crossed with a crook over the chest of the dead king. The flail is a short-handled rod from which hangs a group of three leather strips decorated with wooden beads and bone. Reportedly, it recorded all of history in the chimerical carvings upon its bone and wood beads. To tap its extensive wisdom, a person simply asked a question, then touched the flail to her brow. The answer came immediately."
 artifact_gauntlets_name: "Gauntlets"
 artifact_gauntlets_description: "Gauntlets are, on the simplest level, a pair of gloves. If that were all they were, however, redcaps wouldn't be quite so fond of them. However, each redcap who makes himself a pair of gauntlets makes sure to stud them with fishhooks, razor blades, broken glass, rusty nails and splinters. No two pairs of gauntlets are alike, and most redcaps swear they can't wear any but their own."
 artifact_dry_dust_name: "Dry Dust"
 artifact_dry_dust_description: "What dry dust does is simple. It makes whoever ingests it (though it always must be ingested in conjunction with food or drink, never by itself) ravenously hungry and unquenchably thirsty for a period of an hour. During that time, the victim will attempt to eat anything — and in some cases anyone — he can get his hands on. Dry dust has a variety of uses, ranging from assisting in poisonings to crude practical jokes. Only redcaps seem to know the secret of its manufacture, and the few who have been questioned about it hint darkly at having ground up human bone to make the stuff. They may be telling the truth, or they may just be trying to make their interviewers uncomfortable. Either way, it speaks volumes."
 artifact_blooded_gauntlets_name: "Blooded Gauntlets"
 artifact_blooded_gauntlets_description: "Whereas the spikes, protrusions, blades and hooks of a regular pair of gauntlets are merely sharp and dangerous, the ones on a pair of Blooded Gauntlets are actively hungry. When they tear into an opponent, they want to stay there, and they'll do as much damage as they can. Witnesses (and the very occasional survivor) swear that the blades and whatnot actually move to rend the flesh of a target once a punch connects. The hooks snag the Blooded Gauntlet in place while the rest of the equipment goes to work, ripping its way down to bone and beyond. The poor fool who takes a stomach punch from a redcap wearing these is doomed to a few very brief moments of agony, and nothing more."
 artifact_grinder_name: "The Grinder"
 artifact_grinder_description: "It cannot be stressed enough that the Grinder can swallow just about anything. Metal? No problem. Dead bodies? Easy as pie. An elephant? It might take a while, but down it goes. And no matter what goes it, the same filling-but-not-very-tasty paste comes out. Of course, the size of the object being tossed in and the raw materials it's made from impact how long it takes for the Grinder to chew it up once and for all, but in the end, if the redcap with the crank is willing to work at it, the device can dispose of pretty much anything imaginable."
 artifact_logis_ashes_name: "Logi's Ashes"
 artifact_logis_ashes_description: "#bold As a [character_interaction|E], allows you unleash [GetModifier('POD_county_great_famine_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] in target's realm.\nGive enemy [commanders|E] [GetModifier('logis_ashes_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] modifier in a war as a [commander|E].#!\nEven a tiny sprinkle of Logi's Ashes has an egregious effect. Once some of the Ashes are scattered, all of the food and drink in the vicinity becomes as dust in the mouths of those who would partake. The effect spreads fast as wildfire, and generally extends for miles. Entire duchies have been laid waste in this manner, as any food that's brought in for up to a year and a day withers in just this fashion."
 artifact_winterblade_name: "Winterblade"
 artifact_winterblade_description: "Some say that winter blade is the scythe that will cut away the Summer of the world and plunge all into Winter. It will chill the earth where it touches and render permanently sterile any ground it rests on. A single nick from its blade is enough to wither a tree of centuries' growth, and the merest scratch will drain the life from a victim. Even those whom Winterblade misses feel the chill of its passage in their very bones and they're lucky if they can find the strength to crawl away before the blade returns."
 artifact_grapes_of_wrath_name: "Grapes of Wrath"
 artifact_grapes_of_wrath_description: "The Grapes are perfect and a deep, rich purple. They gleam invitingly and flicker with Glamour to any who look closely enough. Those who eat a Grape feel slightly intoxicated and start to lose their inhibitions. The more they eat, the more uninhibited they become. They Grapes contain no actual alcohol, though, so motor skills are not impaired."
 artifact_horn_of_hermes_name: "Horn of Hermes"
 artifact_horn_of_hermes_description: "Made of brass, this tarnished treasure looks like a helicon, or a large tuba. Its surface has pock-marks and the insignia of winged boots, Hermes' sigil. Hermes served as messenger of the Unseelie fae of Olympus and was known among mortals as the patron of travelers. He and Dionysus developed a friendship and after Hera's second attempt on Dionysus' life, Hermes gave him the horn."
 artifact_halcyon_halter_name: "Halcyon Halter"
 artifact_halcyon_halter_description: "The halcyon was a bird, identified with the kingfisher, that had the ability to soothe the winds and waves when it nested upon the sea during the winter solstice. The bird's legend originated in Greece where sailors threw sweet biscuits into the Mediterranean Sea to draw it and then, in the calmer seas, near their ports. Decorated with the bird's feathers, this halter makes an X across the chest of its wearer, crossing right over the heart where the brightest feathers stand out."
 artifact_minoan_mosaic_name: "Minoan Mosaic"
 artifact_minoan_mosaic_description: "The ancient art of mosaics was developed in ancient Greece. It involves setting pieces of colored tile in mortar to form a picture or decorative design. The Minoan Mosaic originated on Crete during the reign of King Minos. According to legend, this treasure shows the image of a faceless person until a changeling gazes into it for an extended period of time. Spending one point of Glamour, the faerie begins to see the face of their one true love appearing amidst the tiles. Narcissus peered into the Minoan Mosaic and was disappointed when the only image he found there was his own. He proclaimed the Mosaic to be a fake. He was apparently proven wrong."
 artifact_sands_of_time_name: "Sands of Time"
 artifact_sands_of_time_description: "#bold As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to heal target's wounds.#!\nGathered one grain at a time from the shores of the Cyclades, a band of 200 Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, this sand holds special healing powers. Some satyr scholars postulate that it is actually tiny pieces of Atlantis that have washed up on the shore. As the centuries go by, the Sands become more and more rare."
 artifact_syrinx_name: "Syrinx"
 artifact_syrinx_description: "The one and only Syrinx was the first pipe made. Many Kithain have heard of this treasure and fear its appearance because it has the ability to inspire incredible passion in those who hear its song. Because it was born of true love, though, it doesn't trigger generic passions as the Gift of Pan does. Instead it makes those who mourn lost love feel the bittersweet pain more acutely and it urges those who do love to act on their emotions with the target of their affection. The music intensifies all of these feelings and solidifies them forevermore. The one who loves, when they hear the music of Syrinx, will love that person forever and maybe beyond."
 artifact_inner_spinners_name: "Inner Spinners"
 artifact_inner_spinners_description: "Creepy, crawly, dark, and dank, the Inner Spinners are instruments of revenge and torture. In essence they are tiny, chimerical arachnids done up in black lacquer and clockwork. When placed in the house or sleeping quarters of their intended victim, they go to work. Once the target is safely dozing, the Spinners scuttle over them and proceed to crawl into their ears, nose, and nostrils. There they spin chimerical webs so thick and sticky that the target may suffocate, choke, or go temporarily deaf."
 artifact_gray_vines_name: "Gray Vines"
 artifact_gray_vines_description: "#bold More likely to [imprison|E] [characters|E] after a successful [siege|E] or [raid|E].#!\nAppearing as a vest the color of fog, the Gray Vines look to be woven in a clever pattern mimicking the growth of wild plants. On closer examination, one can tell that the waistcoat is actually made from twining, thorny vines which, thankfully, remain still."
 artifact_gloves_of_night_name: "Gloves of Night"
 artifact_gloves_of_night_description: "While the underfolk can twist their bodies to fit into nearly any crevice or opening, there are times when even the most flexible will find themself stopped by a locked door. For those moments, the Gloves of Night come in handy. By spending a point of Glamour, the flesh within the Gloves can be liquified or solidified at the whim of the wearer. This allows the crawler wearing them to remodel their digits into claws, suction cups, or even lock-picks. The user can also choose the consistency of the mutated fingers, allowing enough rigidity for a fleshy lock-pick to turn tumblers without lacerations."
 artifact_wordspider_name: "Wordspider"
 artifact_wordspider_description: "A chimerical, mechanical, methodical breaker of codes and discoverer of secrets. Small enough to fit into the average crawler's palm, a Wordspider looks like it was spun from green and gold glass. Its mandibles are unusually long and careful observation discovers wiry protrusions from each "foot.""
 artifact_cold_light_name: "Cold Light"
 artifact_cold_light_description: "#bold Give [GetModifier('cold_light_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] [modifier|E] to enemy [knights|E] when acting as a [commander|E] during the [combat_phase|E], or to your foe during [single_combat_duel_plural|E].#!\nAppearing as a dagger carved from a single, titan icicle, Cold Light shines an eerie blue at all times. It radiates intense cold, causing a bitter chill to strike down all in the vicinity, save its wielder and their allies (who feel a pleasant briskness in the air). Upon command, Cold Light can also increase the intensity of its blaze, blinding all who stand before it."
 artifact_brooch_of_the_true_suitor_name: "Brooch of the True Suitor"
 artifact_brooch_of_the_true_suitor_description: "These are simple metal brooches that draw no attention to themselves save for the simplicity and quality of their craftsmanship. To those who know their powers, however, they are invaluable aids in the pursuit of true love. Should a true suitor wear one while confronting the object of their affection, they will seem more relaxed and at ease than they might otherwise."
 artifact_highland_blade_name: "Highland Blade"
 artifact_highland_blade_description: "These enchanted blades are growing increasingly rare, for the means of their construction are either lost, or the nockers aren't talking. Most common among them are claymores, though other edged variants exist. So long as the wielder possesses even one point of Glamour, they will not suffer any ill effect on account of terrain."
 artifact_rorys_bag_name: "Rory's Bag"
 artifact_rorys_bag_description: "Named for Red Rory, these are all large bags of sturdy construction, though individual models may vary on color and construction. Nevertheless, each is large enough to contain enough food and drink to sustain one adult troll for one day. If a changeling spends one point of Glamour, a full meal of travel rations will appear. Note that these are real rations and not chimerical and as such will offer real sustenance."
 artifact_shield_of_virtue_name: "Shield of Virtue"
 artifact_shield_of_virtue_description: "These large, round shields are legendary treasures and no more than two are known to exist. Said to have been the shields of the twin brothers Torvald and Bohr, each has the power to strengthen the will of an honorable troll and offer extraordinary protection in battle. So long as the troll is true to their oaths and their given word, the shield will be weightless in battle and offer extra defense."
 artifact_maul_of_thunder_name: "Maul of Thunder"
 artifact_maul_of_thunder_description: "#bold Can recruit [GetMaA('electricity_elemental').GetName] as [men_at_arms|E].#!\nThis mighty maul is said to have been one crafted by trolls under the direct instructions of Thor, to be used should he ever lose Mjolner. It is said to be the mightiest of all troll weapons, and perhaps even the equal to Caliburn, the sword of High King David. Among its rumored powers include the abilities to leap any body of water in a single bound, to level any wall with a single blow, to command the elements, and it is said to emit a shocking boom of thunder whenever it strikes."
 artifact_eye_of_opening_name: "Keystone"
 artifact_eye_of_opening_description: "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Glamour, first spend the Glamour stored in this Glamour Vessel.\nAuto-refill every month.#!\nThe Keystone, also known as the Eye of Opening, is an emerald. Given to the guardianship of the nockers, it opens anything it touches, regardless of whether the object is simply closed or securely locked and warded. It is powerful enough to open portals that lead to other realms, so long as they are not barred from the other side as well. Its true power, though, lies in its ability to open up the hearts of people and as a means of uncovering information that has been locked away or forgotten. It is a stimulator of memories."
 artifact_waystone_name: "Waystone"
 artifact_waystone_description: "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Glamour, first spend the Glamour stored in this Glamour Vessel.\nAuto-refill every month.#!\nThe Waystone, a deep blue sapphire, was given to the Clurichaun. It is both a pathfinder and a locator, leading its holder to the place they need to be or the object to person they need to find. It also has a deeper use in that it will often lead people to their destinies."
 artifact_changestone_name: "Changestone"
 artifact_changestone_description: "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Glamour, first spend the Glamour stored in this Glamour Vessel.\nAuto-refill every month.#!\nThe Changestone, a fiery ruby, was given to the satyrs to guard. It confers the power to change its holder's appearance in the mortal world and tends to alter circumstances in their favor, at times to the detriment of those around them. Its real magic, though, lies in its ability to transform someone into their true self; restoring such a one to their faerie nature. Some believe the gem can even reverse the process of mortal aging."
 artifact_shadowstone_name: "Shadowstone"
 artifact_shadowstone_description: "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Glamour, first spend the Glamour stored in this Glamour Vessel.\nAuto-refill every month.#!\nThe Shadowstone, a black opal, was entrusted to the Menehune of Hawai'i. It has the power to absorb and transform Banality and increases the holder's ability to act "in the shadows," for example by stealth or in darkness. When used by those who understand the true interplay between Banality and Glamour, the gem can purify a changeling, cleansing them of all Banality without the unfortunate side effect of causing Bedlam. In some ways it is the most powerful and dangerous of the four stones, inevitably corrupting all but the strongest of personalities through inuring them to Banality's harshness. It sends dark dreams as well."
 artifact_ship_of_the_four_quarters_name: "Ship of the Four Quarters"
 artifact_ship_of_the_four_quarters_description: "One of the great treasures of the fae of old, the Ship of the Four Quarters was shaped much like a viking longship and was invested by the Inanimae with the power to control the five elements. It was Conar of House Dougal who oversaw the ship's construction but it was Kyria Vowseeker of House Gwydion who journeyed to the lords of the Great Slow Empires, sealing pacts of assistance with each one. The ship moved freely on the waters; for a short while it could also travel on the land, through rock and tree, through the air or even across fire. Only one person was required to steer the ship, so long as the captain was of noble blood."

 artifact_warhorse_nostory_name: "Horse"

 artifact_wolf_description: "Few sounds in nature are more chilling than a wolf's howl. Somehow it encompasses everything humanity fears about the wilderness, as well as everything we ache for."
 artifact_bear_name: "Bear"
 artifact_bear_description: "Rearing like a man on her stout legs, the bear dwells in cold, lonely places — heavily forested kingdoms with water (and fish) nearby."
 artifact_lion_name: "Lion"
 artifact_lion_description: "With their golden coats and the long, full manes of the males, lions are magnificent creatures."
 artifact_tiger_name: "Tiger"
 artifact_tiger_description: "Huge, sleek and lithe, these beautiful animals move swiftly through the jungle shadows, camouflaged by their striped coats."
 artifact_dragon_name: "[owner.Custom('DragonStoryName')]"
 artifact_dragon_description: "The dragon is the unreasoning enforcer of the natural order. It is quite literally the scourge of the Earth — the lash of Her displeasure with presumptuous humanity. A great wyrm embodies man's relation with nature. Within its glistening coils, we do not find a natural order to be conquered, catalogued and cultivated, but rather the wild fury of nature that must be appeased to ensure survival.\nThankfully, even those terrifying creatures have to grow to their tremendous size. Finding a small dragon is a rare feat, but certainly preferable to finding an adult one."
 artifact_animal_hide_name_dragon: "[owner.Custom('DragonStoryNamePossessive')] Pelt"
 artifact_unicorn_name: "[owner.Custom('UnicornStoryName')]"
 artifact_unicorn_description: "Modern lore depicts the unicorn as a magnificent snowy white, long-maned horse with delicate features — with an ivory-colored horn rising from its forehead. In reality, unicorns have little in common with horses save their size. The horned beasts' build and features, particularly their large dark eyes, are similar to a deer's. Their tails are several feet in long and, like that of a lion, tipped with a furry tuft. Covered in soft, off-white hair, a unicorn's streamlined body is built for speed. A unicorn's talon-sharp hooves resemble those of a goat, and are formidable weapons."
 artifact_animal_hide_name_unicorn: "[owner.Custom('UnicornStoryNamePossessive')] Pelt"
 artifact_pegasus_name: "[owner.Custom('PegasusStoryName')]"
 artifact_pegasus_description: "As wild and natural as the gems from which its wings draw their coloration — sapphire, ruby, emerald and amethyst — a pegasus is a rare and valuable creature. It glides through the air like quicksilver, gleaming in the sun and executing complicated maneuvers with the utmost facility. A substantial pair of wings spreads out from its shoulders in flight and folds smoothly against its body at rest. Obsidian-black hooves thunder on the ground with the force of the legendary steed that split the crags atop Helicon and unleashed the Muses' sacred waters."

 artifact_kohl_of_the_hawk_lord_description: "This never-fading jar of kohl, a sensuous eye makeup, draws on the power of a longdead relic headcloth. The wearer cannot be dazzled or overheated by the sun or fire, and he gains extra Social advantage."
 artifact_screens_of_the_harem_name: "Screens of the Harem"
 artifact_screens_of_the_harem_description: "These printed wall hangings draw on relic curtains that covered the beautiful souls in A’aru who composed the harems of dead pharaohs. They are hung where they will be visible: near a campsite, on a laundry line or over a window. Anyone seeing them will immediately look at something else and forget that they came to the place or what they are there for. Mummies use these powerful phylacteries to hide."
 artifact_khopesh_of_balance_name: "Khopesh of Balance"
 artifact_khopesh_of_balance_description: "#bold As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to heal target's wounds.#!\nThis phylactery is a powerful weapon of healing. A mummy made it when she performed the Nefesh on a sword and an ancient box of healing ointment that lay in the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Underworld')]. When swung at someone while the mummy spends Lifeforce, the sword heals any wounds that they suffer."
 
 artifact_ideograph_charm_description: "These charms, bearing pictographs of the ancient kaja script, may be made of silk, jade or even paper; jade, however, tends to keep the best."
 
 artifact_soultaker_name: "Soultaker"
 artifact_soultaker_description: "#bold Unlock $EXECUTION_SOULTAKER$ [executions|E].\nAllow to, when needing to spend Resolve, first spend the Resolve stored in this Resolve Vessel.#!\nForged at the bloody height of the war, Soultaker is an obscene and terrible weapon. The willing soul of a demon — his name long since forgotten — was bound into the black metal, where he could use this power upon anyone touched by the blade. The sword’s touch drained the energy and life from anyone it wounded — and if it killed a victim, his soul would be pulled from his corpse and imprisoned within the blade, there to be tortured and devoured by the original demon. Mortals and angels alike fell before Soultaker, their Faith torn apart for his sustenance.\nThen the sword’s bearer used it to slay another demon, and the sword changed. The two demonic souls fought for dominance within the blade, neither able to gain an advantage. Over time, their souls began to bleed into each other, creating a single fractured personality. As demonic infighting grew more serious in the war, more demons fell to Soultaker, and their souls became absorbed into a single insane entity — a being that called itself Legion. Soultaker was lost during the final days of the war, hidden deep in a forgotten weapons cache, and without new victims to devour for Faith, Legion grew weak and thin. Now it can think of nothing but food — Faith — and it will do anything to devour fresh souls once more."
 artifact_the_black_throne_of_genhinnom_name: "The Black Throne of Genhinnom"
 artifact_the_black_throne_of_genhinnom_description: "Created by Lucifer, this throne of black obsidian and siyr sat at the center of the Black Cathedral, the rebel city of Genhinnom, in the time of the war. From this throne, Lucifer commanded his legions, consulted with his generals and wept for the fate of humanity and the fall of the Elohim. Genhinnom was destroyed by the angels after the rebels were sent to Hell, but a city of this power, this beauty, can never be completely destroyed. Parts of the Black Cathedral still exist in different levels of reality, and the black throne, the 20- foot-tall chair of commanders, can still be found.\nThe throne is a massive chair, made of stone and metal. It’s incredibly uncomfortable to sit in, but that’s the price you have to pay for power — and the throne is powerful. It allows the demon sitting in the chair to command legions of followers — hundreds or thousands of loyal mortals that will do almost anything in your service."
 artifact_soulforge_name: "The Soulforge"
 artifact_soulforge_description: "#bold As a [character_interaction|E], allows you to sacrifice a demon to kill every one in target's realm.#!\nThe Soulforge is a large, ornately angular cage of copper and other metals, engraved on every surface with runes and sigils that can no longer be translated. Hooks and spikes line the inner part of the cage, while four wide, coiled flanges radiate from the top.\nThis terrible device was crafted by Schatenkoji the Ghostsmith, master of death and invention, one of the great relic-makers of the Ebon Legion during the Age of Wrath. It allows for the slaughter of hundreds of mortals at the user’s whim. The souls of those dead can then be collected and enslaved in demonic relics."

 artifact_somber_axe_description: "Of all the many weapons used in the War on Heaven, the Somber Axes were particularly feared.

 artifact_book_grave_war_description: "A strange book alternating between German, ancient Greek and Minoan, this book is physically unremarkable, appearing to be an illuminated manuscript of poor quality.\nThe book is divided into seven cantos. Each canto varies wildly in length and structure, and some are entirely in verse form. Other cantos are part poem and part prose, while others are entirely prose.

 artifact_old_glory_name: "Old Glory"
 artifact_old_glory_description: "The tattered remains of a battle flag, Old Glory does not show one country or movement’s colors. Rather, it endlessly cycles, bouncing from a Civil War regimental flag one moment to the Tricolor the next, to the Jolly Roger. Supposedly it has never shown the same flag twice, though when it is unfurled, anyone watching it is missing the point."  
 artifact_sweeneys_pride_name: "Sweeney’s Pride"
 artifact_sweeneys_pride_description: "This unassuming straight razor, with a finely honed blade and mother-of-pearl inlay in the oak handle, appears fairly innocuous. However, it has claimed far more than its share of wraiths over the three centuries it’s existed. Passed from hand to hand and owner to owner, the razor, sarcastically named Sweeney’s Pride, gives its wielder additional Strength while she’s wielding it."  
 artifact_emperors_nightingale_name: "Emperor’s Nightingale"
 artifact_emperors_nightingale_description: "A cunningly crafted clockwork bird dating back to the glory days of Athens, the nightingale has been thoroughly and repeatedly reworked. Now sporting a coat of precious gems and endless improvements to its articulation, it has also acquired a most peculiar power. Namely, the owner of the nightingale can infuse the bird with Pathos and whisper the name of something, or someplace, or someone, that he wants found. The bird will immediately take flight and head for the requested target. It flies at a slow, but steady and unbroken pace so that its owner can follow, though anyone using the nightingale must be prepared for rough travel. The bird will literally go to the ends of the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Underworld')] as needed to find its target, whether that be the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('far_shore','Far Shores')] or the heart of the [UmbraGlossary('pod_realm_labyrinth')]."  
 artifact_bell_of_summoning_name: "Bell of Summoning"
 artifact_bell_of_summoning_description: "Imported from the Jade Empire, this item resembles a small jade bell and hammer. Wraiths may choose to invest as many Pathos into the bell as they want. Thereafter, any time the bell is struck, any wraith who still has Pathos invested in the bell will be able to hear the summons and answer it, instantly aware of the bell’s location."  
 artifact_masks_name: "Masks"
 artifact_masks_description: "Most masks are symbolic of the offices the wearer holds. The most bedraggled looking ragamuffin wearing the mask of an Anacreon will automatically receive the respect due that office. As such, there is a thriving black market in both stolen and counterfeit masks. A good forgery can get a wraith into a Citadel unquestioned, though it may not get him out again."  
 artifact_instant_nihil_name: "Instant Nihil"
 artifact_instant_nihil_description: "A favorite among criminals, Renegades, and Legionnaires at isolated outposts, Instant Nihils look like glass bottles full of ink. They’re fragile and must be handled carefully lest they break, but when activated (which is to say, broken), within one turn they produce a [GetModifier('nihil_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] six feet wide. A wraith in close pursuit of the user of the Instant Nihil may falling in and winding up in the [UmbraGlossary('pod_realm_tempest')]. Conversely, a non-Harbinger who finds himself cornered might use one to facilitate his escape from a tight situation."  
 artifact_redeyes_name: "Redeyes"
 artifact_redeyes_description: "A pair of soulfire torches in relic glass spheres, Redeyes blaze with a light that can be seen up to a mile away through the froth and churn of the Tempest. Each set of Redeyes is rated to last a full year, and at least one set is carried by each Legionnaire on patrol in the storm itself. When released into the [UmbraGlossary('pod_realm_tempest')], a set of Redeyes hovers in position until the soulfire crystals powering the lanterns burn out. They are useful for marking patrol routes for wraiths detailed to the Tempest, search-and-rescue teams, and work details caught far from a Byway."
 artifact_scribblers_pen_name: "Scribbler’s Pen"
 artifact_scribblers_pen_description: "Gifts from Nhudri to the keepers of the Great Library, Scribbler’s Pens let a wraith transcribe the words that otherwise would have gone unspoken. Trained in its use, a wraith can use the pen to write down either Pathos or Angst, transforming it into words of either shimmering silver or inky black that never appear to dry."
 artifact_soulfire_mask_name: "Soulfire Mask"
 artifact_soulfire_mask_description: "Not every mask is just a symbol. Certain Hierarchs have combined symbology with deadly practicality. Designed for use as weapons, these masks, which are largely the property of high-ranking Hierarchs, sport an arrangement of soulfire crystals. When activated, the mask can belch out a tongue of flame. Alternately, it can surround its wearer with a blazing aura that can absorb damage."
 artifact_soulfire_lantern_name: "Soulfire Lantern"
 artifact_soulfire_lantern_description: "Rather than illuminate, this lantern shrouds its holder in shadows, hiding her from sight. The lantern’s light is a 10-Pathos soulfire shard. When the user activates the crystal, stored Pathos is consumed and the lantern and its wielder vanish from sight. All that’s visible is a dim, bobbing light that, curiously enough, is also visible across the Shroud."
 artifact_star_of_the_east_name: "Star of the East"
 artifact_star_of_the_east_description: "Looking like nothing so much as a Christmas-tree ornament made from spun sugar, the Star of the East is considered an eccentric affectation by some, a lifesaving tool by others. When inactive, it will maintain an irregular orbit around its owner’s head. Once activated, however, the star immediately flies off in the direction of the most pressing danger facing the wraith. If the threat is within 10 yards, the star will hover over it. Otherwise, it will hold position in the direction of the threat for a full hour before needing to be recharged, or returning to its normal orbit."
 artifact_candelabra_of_souls_name: "Candelabra of Souls"
 artifact_candelabra_of_souls_description: "As evil as it is sought after, the candelabra appears to be a gracefully crafted work in polished brass. Each one has nine branches, with a variable number of arms coming off each branch, and each arm ends in a sconce for a fat candle, into which a wraith Moliated into candle form is meant to be set and set alight."
 artifact_stygian_steel_armor_name: "Stygian Steel Armor"
 artifact_stygian_steel_armor_description: "Not many can claim to own such a prize. Highly ornate and often decorated with crests and other seemingly nonfunctional elements, the armor is actually quite serviceable. Each suit is different, ranging from expansions of hoplite armor to full-blown medieval plate mail. What matters is that in each case, the wearer’s torso is protected."
 artifact_stygian_wall_flies_name: "Stygian Wall Flies"
 artifact_stygian_wall_flies_description: "Messengers and spies, these cunningly crafted simulacra of [Glossary('Skinlands','game_concept_skinlands_desc')] insects can go anywhere in the level of reality (Stygia or the [UmbraGlossary('shadowlands')]) to observe and report, and only the sharpest-eyed wraiths can spot them. By spending Pathos, a fly’s owner can look through the eyes of his Artifact, no matter how far away it is. Spend more, and he can hear as well; spend even more allows him to speak through it."
 artifact_living_chains_name: "Living Chains"
 artifact_living_chains_description: "Made from Stygian steel, not soulsteel, these chains are not used to imprison. Rather, they empower the wearer. Once activated, the chains anchor themselves in the back of their user, doing aggravated damage (which cannot be healed until the chains are removed). The remainder of the jet-black links wrap themselves around the wearer, effectively giving her the equivalent of a set of soulsteel armor as well as an offensive weapon. At the wielder’s command, the chains can strike independent targets up to 20 feet away."
 artifact_fetterguard_name: "Fetterguard"
 artifact_fetterguard_description: "Few Artifacts are more precious — or more precarious — than the Fetterguard. Appearing as nothing more than a small soulsteel box, inside it holds miniature versions of its owner’s $pod_Fetters$. Each of these must be made by the wraith herself, though whether she does it through the forge, through Moliate, or through putting together bits and bobs she recovered in the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('shadowlands','Underworld')] makes no difference. As long as these icons remain safe within the box, no harm will come to them in the real world, and even supernatural attempts at damaging them will somehow go awry."
 artifact_beasthide_name: "Beasthide"
 artifact_beasthide_description: "Beasthide is exactly what it sounds like, a square of tanned skin taken from a plasmic or other such beast. The skin is rough and scaly, and is a noxious green in color, but it does have one admirable quality. When used to polish a relic or Stygian steel blade, it somehow sharpens it beyond what it was capable of holding before. The effect lasts for the duration of the battle. The typical piece of Beasthide has a dozen uses in it before it falls to shreds."
 artifact_bloodwebs_name: "Bloodwebs"
 artifact_bloodwebs_description: "#bold Allow to, when needing to spend Pathos, first spend the Pathos stored in this Pathos Vessel.#!\nNhudri took Charon’s commandment that nothing go to waste seriously, as evidenced by his creation of the Bloodwebs. Blue-black netting formed from the veins and arteries of the great beast, Bloodwebs can be thrown over a target at a range of up to 10 yards. Once they hit, they will entangle their victim and start sucking Pathos out of him."
 artifact_shroudripper_gloves_name: "Shroudripper Gloves"
 artifact_shroudripper_gloves_description: "Made from finest plasmic-skin leather and crowned with the carefully harvested talons of Shroudrippers, these gloves are a deadly addition to a wraith’s arsenal. They leak Shroudripper acid into any wound they cause, making the wound impossible to heal for 24 hours."
 artifact_wail_tongue_name: "Wail Tongue"
 artifact_wail_tongue_description: "It is said that the Wail Tongue is what made Nhudri decide once and for all that he was done working with Skin Artifacts. It’s a sliver of the tongue of a plasmic, inlaid with a network of fine, Stygian-steel wire. This foul device must then be placed by a wraith in his own mouth, where it will immediately and painfully devour the wraith’s own tongue. In addition, the wraith’s speech patterns permanently change, becoming harsher, more metallic, and oftentimes flat-out chilling."
 artifact_guardian_orb_name: "Guardian Orb"
 artifact_guardian_orb_description: "Bulky but incredibly potent, this Artifact consists of a milky white, beach-ball-sized eyeball, complete with optic nerve, set within a thin circular brace made of Stygian steel. A smaller ring is worn by the Orb’s user, behind whom the Orb will bob and float. Not only does the Orb allow its owner to see behind herself, it also maneuvers itself between its owner and any incoming projective attacks. Each Orb will move to intercept anything from a paper airplane to a careening relic chariot."
 artifact_forgebait_name: "Forgebait"
 artifact_forgebait_description: "Forgebait looks like an obolus. Close examination will show that it’s a clever forgery, but most wraiths would have no reason to suspect such. The Forgebait will continue to act like an obolus (moaning, etc.) until such time as the wraith tries to use it to pay for something. At that moment, it will disintegrate into a foul-smelling slime. The stink will stay with the would-be buyer for a week, letting all who pass know that this is a wraith whose coin is not to be trusted."
 artifact_memory_net_name: "Memory Net"
 artifact_memory_net_description: "#bold Higher chance of gaining [artifact|E] in Adventure into Maelstroms $pod_umbra$ action.#!\nSkilled Spectres can often pull useful flotsam from the [UmbraGlossary('pod_realm_tempest')], but even the most talented have uneven luck. However, they can up their odds if they use a Memory Net. Supposedly made from the hair and bone of a captured angelic, a Memory Net is a golden net of shimmering strands attached to a bone hoop and rod construction. The entire structure, on close examination, bears a suspicious resemblance to a human arm. The diameter of the hoop’s opening is three feet, which is the maximum size for something to be plucked from the waves."
 artifact_bean_nighe_caul_name: "Bean Nighe Caul"
 artifact_bean_nighe_caul_description: "#bold As a execution option, allows you to feed the target's soul to the Caul increase your education or an attribute.#!\nOne of the most revolting Spectral Artifacts known to exist is the hideous bodysuit called the Bean Nighe Caul. Crafted from the tattered, torn remains of various wraiths’ faces, the Caul’s components have been caught forever in moments of tormented anguish. Any [GetTrait('spectre').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] who owns the Caul must spend a $pod_Corpus$ a week to feed it, or the Caul will start to feed on itself until there’s nothing left of it."


 artifact_bottle_of_fire_name: "Bottle of Fire"
 artifact_bottle_of_fire_description: "A squat bottle of red glass standing four-inches high, the bottle of fire appears unremarkable until the brass stopper is removed and the bottle turned upside down. At that point, a hot-burning liquid pours out of the bottle and moves away from the user. As it moves, the fire causes all flammable items in its path to burst into flame. When the mage has caused enough destruction, he need only replace the stopper."
 artifact_cauldron_of_spies_name: "Cauldron of Spies"
 artifact_cauldron_of_spies_description: "The cauldron of spies is a Verbena Artifact par excellence. The mage needs only fill the cauldron with water and bring it to an energetic boil and then speak the right words and out of the water will shoot a number of bats (if it’s night) or rooks (if it’s daylight). These animals are connected to the mage telepathically, and whatever they see, she sees. These creatures have a range of several miles from the mage and they last for 12 hours, at which point they dive into the nearest, deepest shadow and fade away (so that they can’t be followed back to the witch who created them)."
 artifact_divine_staff_of_fortuitous_intervention_name: "The Divine Staff of Fortuitous Intervention"
 artifact_divine_staff_of_fortuitous_intervention_description: "This defensive Artifact looks like nothing more than a four-foot staff carved from a fine-grained white wood.\nIn combat, however, the divine staff of fortuitous intervention is a wonder to behold as it whirls in the hands of the mage wielding it, blocking, parrying and deflecting all manner of blows and weapons fire." 
 artifact_dream_spirit_bag_name: "Dream Spirit Bag"
 artifact_dream_spirit_bag_description: "This ornamental bag is covered with beautiful beads and it is full of sleep. When the mage wants a target to fall asleep, he simply blows a handful of sleep at his target."
 artifact_great_sigil_pendant_name: "Great Sigil Pendant"
 artifact_great_sigil_pendant_description: "Dealing with Umbrood as often as they do, the mages of the Houses of Hermes have, of necessity, developed some potent Artifacts to give them the upper hand in their spirit dealings. The great sigil pendant is a disk of steel around three inches in diameter engraved with a complex magical glyph."
 artifact_serpent_pen_name: "Serpent Pen"
 artifact_serpent_pen_description: "Serpent pens are relatively sophisticated assassination tools for use against individuals who are otherwise too well guarded. These Artifacts look like green or golden pens, but aside from that they vary a great deal. Some have an ornate scale pattern down the length of the barrel while others are relatively plain.\nThe pen is somehow slipped into pocket or bag of the target. When the target has forgotten about the pen, it transforms into a small, highly poisonous snake and bites the target when he’s sleeping."
 artifact_spiritual_armor_name: "Spiritual Armor"
 artifact_spiritual_armor_description: "#bold Wound enemy [knights|E] and [commanders|E] when acting as a [commander|E] during the [combat_phase|E] or your foe during [single_combat_duel_plural|E], if they are vampires (or other supernaturals that fear the sun).#!\nCombat is really not a Celestial Chorister’s specialty (although Templars are just as likely to use this Artifact as Choristers), but there are times when it becomes necessary. The mage puts on this fine mesh armor before going into battle and receives a number of benefits for doing so."
 artifact_trance_drum_name: "Trance Drum"
 artifact_trance_drum_description: "Used primarily by Ecstatics, the trance drum allows anyone familiar with trance states to enter one after just a few drum beats. Trance drums have a hollow, resonant and deeply pleasing tone to them when struck and effectively make it easy to shrug off conscious thought for as long as anyone is playing."
 artifact_clay_man_amulet_no_suffix_name: "Clay Man Amulet"
 artifact_clay_man_amulet_name: "Clay Man Amulet #Weak ([clay_man.MakeScope.GetVariable('clay_man_protection').GetValue|0]/5)#!"
 artifact_clay_man_amulet_description: "#bold Protect from taking wounds.#!\nAmong the most coveted Charms created by the Dreamspeakers are clay man amulets. The clay man is a small, human-shaped, brightly decorated clay figurine worn on a cord around the neck. Anyone wanting to get the protective benefits of a clay man amulet must attune it to himself by anointing it with his own blood or semen. Once anointed, the clay man becomes a powerful protective charm. The next five times the character takes damage (while wearing the amulet), the clay man absorbs the wound in its entirety. This includes wounds brought about by physical combat, poison and magic. Each wound causes one of the clay man’s limbs to crumble to dust. With the fifth and final wound, the head of the clay man crumbles and the Charm is destroyed."

Furthermore, for each voice singing in harmony with the bell, the radius of protection is increased by 10 feet. If the singer attempts to do anything else besides sing (e.g., walk, read) the spell is broken and the bell cracks."

Although most of it is in academic Latin, portions are encrypted in metaphors, ciphers, diagrams, quatrains, Enochian revelations and, of course, prophecy.

Some believe this book describes cycles of existence, a litany of aeons that rose and fell before recorded history.

 artifact_lilith_shard_description: "A shard delving into the origins and motives of the Dark Mother who educated the Dark Father into the arts of the Blood, the shard drips with the venom of her barely contained rage.

 artifact_martial_shard_description: "A shard with a comprehensive analysis on warfare and training, the shard has an air of discipline and ferocity, the wisdom of a thousand battles impressed within.

 artifact_learning_shard_description: "A shard containing a remarkably comprehensive thesis on the oldest Paths of Morality, the nuances of Humanity, Kingship, and other Cainite Theological matters.

 artifact_genesis_shard_name: "Primordial Codex Shard"                  
 artifact_genesis_shard_description: "A shard that feels impossibly old and has the remains of a peach tree root stuck in it, the events this shard details are contradictory and ancient, as it moves between a morass of timelessness and the creation of the universe.
