 shintai_the_shintai_of_ash_and_fire_perk_name: "Shintai of Ash and Fire"
 SHINTAI_FEARLESS_FIRE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor Teachers of Ash and Flame make use of a special weapon, a long staff tipped on both ends with torch-fire. Students of Ash master their fear of flame by learning to dance through the teacher's thrusts and swings; students of Flame go fire for fire, wielding their own burning staves in deadly sparring matches.#!"
 SHINTAI_DANCE_OF_EMBERS_PERK_EFFECT: "Become immune to fire.\n#flavor Initiates of Ash and Flame are made to walk through a labyrinth constructed from numerous bonfires and torches. At any moment, the flames can take human form and embrace the Hungry One (or outright attack, in the case of Flame), shaped by a watchful adept or master. The Demon Art of Iron Mountain is forbidden here; if you burn, you burn.#!"
 SHINTAI_BEAUTIFUL_SPARK_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor Students no longer spend long meditations in the Night Kingdom, trying to summon warming fire with fingers frozen solid- Lord [Glossary('Emma-O','podgloss.emmao')], it seems, will no longer tolerate visitors. The alternative was once freezing caves and glaciers, but the modern advent of industrial freezers has been a blessing.#!"
 SHINTAI_FIRE_TEMPERED_SOUL_PERK_EFFECT: "All sun-related [POD_aggravated_damage_with_box|E] will be limited to 1 [POD_damage|E].\n#flavor The 'Daylight Meditation' is exactly what it sounds like: The student of Ash sits before the horizon, staying for as long as he dares. Among students of Flame, the Meditation is a battle with blades at sunrise, in which neither is allowed to stop until one shames himself by calling for mercy.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_ASH_AND_FIRE_PERK_EFFECT: "Sunlight now deals [POD_superficial_damage_with_box|E]. Become immune to sun-based murder methods.\n#flavor The master is a burning god, wreathed instantly in heat and destructive power... Or else he becomes as close as the Hungry Dead can come to a human being, able to walk in the sun without fear.#!"

 SHINTAI_EYES_IN_THE_BLOOD_PERK_EFFECT: "Every year, heal your blindness, even if it's otherwise permanent.\n#flavor A lay student of Blood will have his eyes, nose and tongue ripped out until he realizes the truth- that he doesn't actually need them anymore. Every sense, every qualia of existence can be experienced entirely through his blood.#!"
 SHINTAI_FLOW_LIKE_BLOOD_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], escape [imprisonment|E].\nYou can't be imprisoned during [sieges|E] or [raids|E] anymore.\n#flavor An initiate of Blood will sit, bound and mummified, across from a tall vase filled with his own fluids, until he can draw every last drop back into his body. From this, he begins to break the illusion of his physical body, comprehending that his true existence is far more fluid.#!"
 SHINTAI_LASH_OF_BLOOD_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor An apprentice of the higher mysteries of Blood must meditate in a pile of his own severed body parts, detaching and reattaching them with intense concentration, until insight is finally achieved.#!"
 SHINTAI_BLOODWALK_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor In ancient nights, students of Blood would test their mettle by emptying their veins down riverways and into the path of typhoons. Wherever the water would take them, so would they go, no matter how far and painful the destination.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_BLOOD_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], shapeshift into [GetModifier('POD_shapeshift_form_blood_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip].\n#flavor A master of the Shintai of Blood understands that there is no true 'body' at all, no 'self'; there is only blood. He dissolves into a sloshing pool of blood, or violently explodes and showers the room with red, and he remains this way for the rest of the scene.#!"

 SHINTAI_RELENTLESS_BONE_PERK_EFFECT: "[POD_aggravated_damage|E] needed to kill you: #P +25%#!.\n#flavor In ancient times, lay students of Bone were once allowed to visit various hells as honored guests, to have the flesh stripped from their bones as they dragged boulders and climbed their way up howling mountains. Modern Hungry Dead tend to prefer simulations over the old way, but the outcome is the same.#!"
 SHINTAI_PUNISHING_BONE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor A feared moment for the student of Bone, the common practice of burying students alive, preferably by triggering a rockslide or under a prepared tonnage of iron ore. There the student of Bone will remain, until she either obtains the insight and strength to smash her way out, or she makes her final peace in the darkness of metal.#!"
 SHINTAI_BONE_OBIEDIENCE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor To become an apprentice of the higher mysteries of Bone, the student subjects herself to the ministrations of a master, allowing her bones to be warped and twisted in painful and puzzling configurations. Then it is simply a matter of sitting in meditation until she reaches sufficient insight to break herself back into the proper shape, and from there to go beyond. In eastern Japan they associate this training with Ebisu, the boneless leech-child of myth and one of the seven gods of fortune.#!"
 SHINTAI_GARDEN_OF_BONES_PERK_EFFECT: "[POD_aggravated_damage|E] needed to kill you: #P +25%#!.\n#flavor At the gateway to mastery, an adept of Bone turns her knowledge outward, experimenting with skeletons both living and dead. Unlike prior training, to obtain this technique requires a different kind of relentlessness: a quiet and studious drive to twist, break, mend, and repeat, over and over, through the screams of the Hungry One's various test subjects- until, at last, understanding comes.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_BONE_PERK_EFFECT: "[POD_health_track|E] boxes: #P +1#!.\n#flavor The master of Bone does not bend to the world; she cuts through it like a knife through sinew and fat. When activated, the Shintai gives the Hungry One a pale and polished shine, as though her entire body has become ossified. [Glossary('Bodhisattvas','podgloss.bodhisattva')] of the Bone Flowers and other ancient Hungry Dead may instead have bodies of pure black metal, so dark that it sucks away the light around it.#!"

 shintai_the_shintai_of_devotion_perk_name: "Shintai of Devotion"
 SHINTAI_THE_FLOW_OF_WORSHIP_PERK_EFFECT: "Every year, discover all [secrets|E] your [CHARACTER.Custom('PODCoterie')] knows of.\n#flavor Unlike other Godbodies, the first stage of the Shintai of Devotion is as natural as opening a door. A fledgling Godling rarely believes in their own divinity right from the start; they must be convinced through experience. But once the Godling knows the truth and obtains their first follower, the whispers quickly begin.#!"
 SHINTAI_YOUR_GOD_BECKONS_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], summon an unlanded [CHARACTER.Custom('PODCoterie')] member to your [court|E].\n#flavor Unlike the heavenly gods, the Godlings cannot be everywhere or see everything their followers do. However, it does not take long striding through the Lower Heavens, rewarding and punishing followers as one sees fit, before destiny and space begin to kowtow to the Godling- as they ought.#!"
 SHINTAI_TOUCH_OF_THE_ASURA_PERK_EFFECT: "All [CHARACTER.Custom('PODCoterie')] members gain [GetModifier('shintai_touch_of_the_asura_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip].\n#flavor In theory, a god is never required to answer prayers; it is only their will and divine vision that leads a Godling to fulfill their followers' desires. In practice, though, Godlings tend to enjoy having legions of followers, and they are quickly taught how to keep the mortals happy and obedient.#!"
 SHINTAI_FESTIVAL_NIGHT_PERK_EFFECT: "Every month, lose @stress_icon![static_stress|E] based on the number of members in your [CHARACTER.Custom('PODCoterie')].\n#flavor The signature power of the Godlings, and the source of the insulting name of 'Prayer-Eating,' a Hungry One comes to understand their direct connection to the flow of spirituality and worship in the mortal world. This normally comes after the Godling enjoys their first true festival in their honor.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_DEVOTION_PERK_EFFECT: "Gain a [strong_hook|E] on all [CHARACTER.Custom('PODCoterie')] members.\n#flavor The Shintai of Devotion, when activated at full mastery, brings the Godling's mortal followers into complete communion with her, body and soul.#!"

 shintai_the_shintai_of_flesh_perk_name: "Shintai of Flesh"
 SHINTAI_EXCELLENT_CORPSE_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], manipulate your [GetTrait('scarred').GetName(GetPlayer)] [trait|E].\n#flavor Many creative deaths await the lay student of Flesh: hanged, sawed in half, crushed... Eventually, the Hungry One comes to understand that there is an art to dying, that even a corpse contains infinite possibilities of expression. In parts of Southeast Asia, this training facilitates the time-honored practice of separating one's upper and lower body when going out to hunt- a reminder to the Hungry Dead, among other things, that there is a time to act human and a time to be honest.#!"
 SHINTAI_FLOWERS_OF_FLESH_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], change a single physical [trait|E] of yours with a cooldown of 10 years.\n#flavor The traditional practice of ritually decapitating a student and burying his head in a garden, so he may reform himself from the remains of other buried corpses and learn the transitive nature of flesh, has become less common over time- Among some Hungry Dead, it's even considered a bit rustic.#!"
 SHINTAI_HUMAN_SCULPTURE_PERK_EFFECT: "Improves [GetPerk('shintai_flowers_of_flesh_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] by increasing the number of [traits|E] you can change to 2 per session.\n#flavor To take pleasure in one's own flesh is one thing; to painstakingly mimic every blink and twitch of a living human being is quite another. Like a student of the visual arts, the apprentice of the higher mysteries of Flesh studies form, figure and motion with single-minded intensity, graduating only when he has chosen a target and copied them to perfection- sometimes to the point where the original is singled out as an 'impostor' and summarily dealt with by those he loved and trusted.#!"
 SHINTAI_A_THOUSAND_FORMS_OF_FLESH_PERK_EFFECT: "Improves [GetPerk('shintai_flowers_of_flesh_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] by decreasing the cooldown to 5 years.\nAs a [character_interaction|E], shapeshift into various animal forms including mythical animals like dragons.\n#flavor There are stories of the heavenly immortals spending time as elegant stallions, or as monkeys in the mountains. In modern nights, a student of Flesh is brought to this enlightenment when a master transforms him into a sparrow or other small creature, and themselves into an apex predator. The student is not allowed to return to human form until he is as fluid and protean as the immortals of legend- or until the master, in disappointment, twists the student into a horror and locks him away to meditate on his failures.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_FLESH_PERK_EFFECT: "Improves [GetPerk('shintai_flowers_of_flesh_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] by lifting the [trait|E] limit and cooldown, as well as allowing it to change the [traits|E] of other characters after passing a [prowess|E] check.\n#flavor Unlike the other corpse-pillars of the Demon Immortals, the Shintai of Flesh is difficult to describe as a specific form: The master, in his perfected state, becomes a vector of pure change. All forms are available to him, and all flesh he touches is like raw clay for the sculpting.#!"

 shintai_the_shintai_of_illusion_perk_name: "Shintai of Illusion"
 SHINTAI_THE_ROOT_OF_ILLUSION_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], force a $POD_splat_vampire$ to frenzy or give them @stress_icon!50 [static_stress|E].\n#flavor Desire is the root of illusion; this is the first lesson all followers learn. A master forces the lay student of Illusion to recognize the hollowness of his attachments, even his deepest and most defining loves- But it is not the master's job to twist and destroy these connections; the student should do such things himself.#!"
 SHINTAI_NON_SELF_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor A master of Illusion can weave an illusion so complete that those within it believe they are what the master says they are: a humble postman, a sultry lover, a serial killer, a beggar. And when the dream fades, and the student of Illusion wakes up to what they really are, where else can that lead but enlightenment?#!"
 SHINTAI_GLITTERING_PARADISE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor Once the student of Illusion understands the basics, they usually pursue illusion-craft with wild abandon. The jump from initiate to apprentice occurs when the student experiences an enormous failure, suffering the consequences of an illusion that falls apart. Then they must sit in the wreckage, whatever it may be, and rebuild.#!"
 SHINTAI_RAKSHASA_BLADE_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], create a random [artifact|E] of #FAMEDBLUE Famed#! [rarity|E].\n#flavor Again and again, the master reminds the student: They are not imposing illusions upon the real world- There is no real world. A so-called illusion is no different from so-called truth. This technique goes a long way toward demonstrating this Dharmic principle, but sometimes an adept must lose a finger or foot before it sinks in.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_ILLUSION_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor The Shintai of Illusion is an illusion-world so complete that the 'real' world bends entirely to its will, for however brief a time.#!"

 shintai_the_shintai_of_jade_perk_name: "Shintai of Jade"
 SHINTAI_SMILING_AT_THUNDER_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor The stereotypical first training in Jade is an exercise in melodrama: a thunderstorm, a jagged cliffside with a long fall and crushing surf below, both master and student barefoot on a slippery path, armed with only fists or knives. The fight does not end until the master says it's over.#!"
 SHINTAI_TREAD_THE_DRAGONS_TAIL_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor Many treatises have been written about the proper movements and postures necessary to achieve understanding of Jade. They are not entirely unhelpful, but there is no substitute for direct experience- The initiate who wishes to master this technique must eventually take a literal leap of faith.#!"
 SHINTAI_EARTHS_EMBRACE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor The Hell of Being Buried Alive is a minor hell-realm, reserved for those who killed others in this very fashion. It is a quiet, grassy field, dotted with a handful of young trees and nothing more- But if you listen to the wind very carefully, you may be able to hear the muffled screams of promising students.#!"
 SHINTAI_CATCHING_THE_WIND_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor To fly like a celestial maiden, one may study for years and decades, or one may journey to the gates of the higher Heavens, petitioning the glorious spirits to teach a lowly Hungry One their ways... Or one can find a celestial maiden exiled to earth, feed on her divine blood, and meditate on the beauty that has been forever lost.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_JADE_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], shapeshift into [GetModifier('POD_shapeshift_form_the_shintai_of_jade_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip].\n#flavor The Shintai of Jade turns the Hungry Dead into divinities of the earth. The ground, sky, and corpse-body are like one, for however long the master can make it last.#!"

 shintai_the_shintai_of_poxes_perk_name: "Shintai of Poxes"
 SHINTAI_TOUCH_OF_THE_STRANGER_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], inflict or heal a disease on your target.\n#flavor There is no shortage of the sick and dying in this world. The compassionate lay student lives among them, learning to bestow a healing touch- or, at times, letting the inevitable take hold with less delay. But not every student of Poxes is so kind.#!"
 SHINTAI_HEMORRHAGIC_STRIKE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor The initiate of Poxes must swallow a parasite demon, traditionally taken from the Hell of Burrowing Maggots. This creature coils around the Hungry One's dead organs and sups at her stolen blood, as the student meditates in silent agony. Eventually, the body absorbs and destroys the demon- But the memory of pain has taught its lesson.#!"
 SHINTAI_FEVERS_PURITY_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], lose @stress_icon!100 [static_stress|E] at cost of gaining [GetTrait('crimson_fever').GetName(GetPlayer)].\n#flavor The apprentice of Poxes accepts a crushing fever, granted by a master or by a powerful spirit- perhaps one of the pox-gods still wandering the Korean peninsula, or a sickly functionary of the Wicked City who carries a bag of dubious medicine. Unfortunately, it takes far more than one bout of fever to understand its purifying powers.#!"
 SHINTAI_WILD_EYED_BULWARK_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], heal [EmptyScope.ScriptValue('POD_wild_eyed_bulwark_heal_value')|V0] [POD_aggravated_damage_with_box|E] at the cost of gaining [GetTrait('crimson_fever').GetName(GetPlayer)].\n#flavor It is said that the higher mysteries of the Shintai of Poxes were in a text stolen from the Mistress of Pestilence herself, smuggled out of the Thousand Hells by having each word transformed into an illness. Those illnesses still appear in the world, waiting for careful and watchful adepts to find, assemble and interpret them.#!"
 SHINTAI_THE_SHINTAI_OF_POXES_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], spawn a major [epidemic|E] of your choosing in your target's location.\n#flavor The Shintai of Poxes, when activated at full mastery, is the raw power of sickness- and feverish insight- given form.#!"

 shintai_the_shintai_of_storms_perk_name: "Shintai of Storms"
 SHINTAI_BREATH_OF_THE_SKY_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor A lay student of Storms watches the air above and studies its movements, meditating under hail and rain as well as starlit skies. More bestial or impatient students will drink the spirit-essence of sylphs, or strap themselves into silken kites to more directly meditate on the power of wind.#!"
 SHINTAI_ARMS_OF_THE_SEA_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], manipulate the weather over a [duchy|E] your target is in.\nUnlocks the #V Drought#! option in the [GetPerk('shintai_arms_of_the_sea_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] [character_interaction|E].\nUnlocks the #V Fertile Land#! option in the [GetPerk('shintai_arms_of_the_sea_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] [character_interaction|E].\n#flavor There are mermaids and gods of the sea- not just the Mother of the Depths and her silver-scaled children, but true beings of the earth's waters, possessed of sagely The Shintai of Storms intelligence and great magic. A student of Storms, with or without a master, seeks out these beings and petitions them for wisdom.#!"
 SHINTAI_THUNDERBOLTS_KISS_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor Finding a lightning bolt to be struck by is quite difficult. It must be a true, natural thunderbolt from the sky, not summoned or created, but drawn directly to the hand- and of course, it must then be survived.#!"
 SHINTAI_CHAMBER_BED_OF_CLOUDS_PERK_EFFECT: "Improves [GetPerk('shintai_arms_of_the_sea_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] by allowing it to target an entire [kingdom|E].\nUnlocks the #V Storm#! option in the [GetPerk('shintai_arms_of_the_sea_perk').GetName(GetPlayer)] [character_interaction|E].#flavor Water, air, the invisible charge of power: All the necessary ingredients are in place, and the adept of Storms traditionally spends years understanding the craft necessary to forge them into the magic of weather. In this age of devilish prodigies, however, a Hungry One may learn to wield the rain in much less time than before.#!"

 SHINTAI_REACH_OF_SMOKE_PERK_EFFECT: "#flavor By concentrating and taking no other action, the Hungry One may give a single column of smoke the solidity and reach of a long tentacle, giving them the ability to take physical actions from sight distance (including combat) as if directly present.#!"
 SHINTAI_A_BODY_OF_SMOKE_PERK_EFFECT: "As a [character_interaction|E], shapeshift into [GetModifier('POD_shapeshift_form_incorporeal_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip].\n#flavor The Hungry Dead transforms into smoke, still humanoid in shape but completely immune to most natural damage sources.#!"
