 POD_podlore.100.desc.POD_fae_character_250: "Два столетия назад сын Рагнельф и Свейна Вилобородого решил попробовать свои силы в управлении смертными. Известный как Кнуд Великий, он правил империей Северного моря, состоявшей из Англии, Дании и Норвегии, до 1034 года. Чтобы править новообращённым (по меркам фей) в христианскую веру населением, Кнуд изучил ритуалы и предания этой веры. Он слишком хорошо подражал благочестивым людям и в конце концов присоединился к делу Константинианцев, хотя Зима и предстала перед ним в образе короля викингов-грабителей, одержимого жаждой завоеваний. Момент его обращения описан в рассказе «Канут и прилив». Король установил свой трон на берегу моря и приказал приливу остановиться, чтобы не намочить ноги и одежды. Он попытался сотворить могущественное заклинание для этого на глазах у истинно верующих... его магия дала сбой. Волна продолжала подниматься, как обычно, и захлестывала его ступни, не обращая внимания на его царственную особу. Кнуд отскочил назад со словами: «Пусть все люди знают, как пуста и никчёмна власть королей, ибо нет никого достойнее этого имени, кроме Того, кому небо, земля и море подчиняются по вечным законам». Затем он повесил свою золотую корону на распятие и никогда больше не надевал её, чтобы восславить Бога, всемогущему царя. Устав от жестокого и смертельного правления, он инсценировал свою смерть и вернулся в дом Асов, чтобы распространять константинианскую веру в доме своих предков."

Для многих это было ужасно - быть изгнанным из своего дома. Но для Батбайбара он не мог быть счастливее. С юности Батбайбар высоко ценил искусство. Начав с изготовления луков и оперения, он предпочитал проводить время за ткачеством гобеленов и резьбой по дереву, а не за охотой. Он был настолько поглощён своим искусством, что, когда на его общину напали, один воин вломился в его юрту, чтобы убить его, битва проиграна, но он был настолько погружён в своё ремесло, что даже не заметил этого. Ему удалось спастись, и он бежал на юго-запад, в сторону Иранского нагорья. Там он был очарован их работами и с энтузиазмом демонстрировал своё мастерство ремесленника. Именно здесь он привлёк внимание Бану Хаким и был принят в их ряды в качестве одного из визирей.\n\nБатбайбар - это картина творческого безумия, охватившего визирей. Но теперь его творчеству помешали. По мере того, как монголы продвигаются вглубь Ирана, он приходит в ужас от разрушений, которые несут некоторые из их полководцев. И, что ещё хуже, [Glossary('Анда','podgloss.anda')] находятся в их тени. Батбайбар ненавидит их поход и хочет сохранить эти великие творения. Поэтому он решил держать оборону от имени клана, решив умереть, прежде чем позволит [Glossary('Анда','podgloss.anda')] уничтожить то, что он так долго защищал."

Аглайя, родившаяся среди далитов-изгнанников из Индии, путешествовавших на запад, была одной из первых из своего народа, кто увидел стены Константинополя. Сразу же ставшая нежеланной и с готовностью закованная в цепи, Навнит планировала бежать со своим народом дальше в глубь Европы, если бы ночью её не встретила женщина и не попросила обсудить с ней философию. Несмотря на то, что Навнит провела много времени в разъездах, она мечтала о родине. Она мечтала о мире, в котором она и её семья могли бы жить легко и свободно, без оков и обременений. Она говорила о местах, на которые надеялась, и сокрушалась, что если бы только у неё были силы, она бы воплотила это в жизнь.\nЖенщина решила, что из неё получилась бы идеальная бруха, когда Навнит рассказала о своём идеальном мире.\n\nС тех пор, как Навнит была обращена, она много путешествовала, ища место, где она могла бы попытаться возродить надежду своего народа, которую теперь смягчила и прояснила утопия Карфагена, о которой рассказывал ей её сир. Однако после возвышения Монгольской империи у неё появились новые возможности. Она видит в этом потенциал, место, где она может построить рай глубоко в степях, синкретизм Карфагена и святилище своей мечты для народа, который впоследствии будет называться романи."

Он обрёл свою славу, когда луланьский король Аньгуй убил нескольких дипломатов. Несмотря на то, что в то время Фу был конюхом, его послали заколоть короля, но вместо этого он предложил другой план и убил Аньгуя, одурачив его подарками и напоив, после чего его стражники немедленно избавились от короля. Фу был горд своим званием, полученным за службу, и позаботился о своей новой должности.\nНо что-то в нём оставалось. Он скучал по учёбе. Он обрёл свою славу, но что-то всё ещё не давало ему покоя. Он хотел узнать больше, он хотел учиться, и он хотел расширить свои знания.\nК своему большому удивлению, он нашёл родственную душу, которая всегда приходила по ночам, чтобы поговорить с ним о природе смерти под тяжёлыми одеяниями. В последние годы смертной жизни они были близкими друзьями. И когда он начал стареть, путешественник предложил ему дар, который позволил бы ему жить той жизнью, которую он оставил позади, в новом состоянии. Фу согласился и был объят каппадокийцем.\n\nС тех пор Фу в основном занимался своими исследованиями самостоятельно. Однако недавний всплеск смертности, вызванный ростом численности монголов, заставил его предпринять более активные действия. Монголы во многом напоминают ему Лулань из его собственной жизни, и из-за того, что они причиняют огромное беспокойство мертвым, он решил действовать. В конце концов, он всегда хотел быть чем-то большим, чем просто книжным червем. И что такое второй король, если его уже можно так легко убить?"

С самого рождения его жизнь в степях была постоянной борьбой. Вечно больной, с открытой неприязнью относившийся к своим товарищам, Темюлен всегда был в стороне и открыто высмеивался остальными членами своей большой семьи. В то время как его семья участвовала в налётах по Европе, он часто был слишком слаб физически, чтобы правильно пользоваться луком, и поэтому в таких походах к нему относились как к бесполезному существу.\nОднако во время одного из вторжений они совершили ошибку, напав не на ту церковь. Ночью в темноте произошел взрыв, поглотивший всех, кто находился внутри. Темюлен бежал изо всех сил, и та ночь стала худшей и последней в его жизни. Несмотря на невозможное, он встретил это так, как всегда. Борясь перед лицом невозможного и отказываясь сдаться и умереть. И это произвело впечатление на нападавшего, который затем объял Темюлена в клан Ласомбра.\nЕго «воспитание» лишь укрепило волю Темюлена к выживанию, но также и его ненависть. Больше всего на свете Темюлен ненавидел систему, которая всегда считала его слабым. А теперь он силен. Для смертных он как бог, и он наслаждается чувством объективного превосходства, которое он теперь имеет над ними. Он наслаждается короной тьмы, возложенной на его голову, и больше ничего не хочет, чтобы сделать ее вечной, чтобы показать всем, кто отверг его, что он силен."

Гобелены, музыка, скульптуры, картины, музыкальные инструменты, архитектура и бесчисленное множество других видов искусства, как физического, так и эмоционального, являются обычным делом. Но Отгонбаяр видит в хорошо воспитанном животном гораздо больше красоты, чем просто в картине.\nВ смертной жизни Отгонбаяр была главным помощником своего клана по уходу за лошадьми и домашним скотом. Каждая пара была её выбором, и она испытывала огромное удовлетворение, наблюдая, как стада и поголовье скота её клана улучшаются в течение нескольких поколений. И так великолепен был ее собственный чистокровный конь, что во время торговой поездки в город ночная фигура была настолько очарована ее работой, что они не могли позволить такой художнице умереть, прежде чем она успеет создать свой шедевр.\nВ целом, объятия не сильно изменили Отгонбаяр, потому что теперь у нее есть все время, чтобы совершенствоваться в науках и искусстве. Ее собственные стада являются одними из лучших в мире, и на протяжении веков спаривание контролировалось для получения идеального потомства. Однако, глядя на свои прекрасные стада, она хочет перейти к следующему шагу. Она оглядывается на людей, которые ее окружают, и, возможно, задается вопросом, можно ли в это время раздора сделать то же самое с человеком..."

Однако во время путешествия их проводник-тремер встретил окончательную смерть, и Дельта вместе со своим выводком отвела их в безопасное место на Урале, прежде чем отправиться дальше на восток.\nТеперь, освободившись от уз крови и сбежав со своими заклятыми спутниками, Дельта ревностно охраняет их новую свободу. Мир ночи в степях - это хаос, и они обладают уникальными навыками выживания в этих регионах, благодаря своим крыльям и способности сливаться с землей. Но еще больше она боится, что тремеры будут искать эту потерянную кладку, независимо от того, насколько напрасными будут их поиски. Поэтому она ревниво охраняет их общее убежище, охотясь вместе и никогда не расставаясь. И по мере того, как хаос [Glossary('Анда','podgloss.anda')] приближается, она вынуждена делать выбор.\nОни продолжат прятаться? Или пытаются создать что-то прочное, чтобы защитить себя изнутри?"

Отправленная со своей стаей на Восток, она освободилась после смерти их наставника-тремера во время вторжения монголов, и, поскольку ей больше некуда было идти, она держалась поближе к Дельте, уходя с ней все глубже в степи.\nОмега - сердце своей стаи, но, прежде всего, она наиболее фанатично предана Дельте. Помимо того, что она была защитницей Омеги в ямах гаргулий, Дельта позволяла Омеге оставаться рядом. Она предана своему делу, и в отсутствие уз крови Омега все глубже погружается в объятия Дельты, чтобы ощутить еще большую ясность и защиту, которые она предлагает.\nНо Омега беспокоится за свою стаю. Поскольку [Glossary('Анда','podgloss.anda')] и другие каиниты степей окружают их, Омега умоляет Дельту построить место, где они смогут прятаться не как животные, а править так, как когда-то правили их хозяева. Она жаждет увидеть корону на голове Дельты и готова на все ради вожака своей стаи. Она просто хочет, чтобы Дельта смотрела на это так же."

Будучи сыном Шашигупты из Паропамисады, Джайиндра увидел, что его дом оказался под угрозой из-за необычайно успешного и неуравновешенного завоевателя, пришедшего с дальнего запада. Но Джайиндра всегда знал, что, когда его отец проявлял крайнюю враждебность по отношению к Александру, это не могло принести ничего хорошего. Идя против воли отца, он немедленно повел своих людей против греков, вступая с ними в бой там, где Александра не было. По большей части, он добивался успеха. Однако, когда он начал продвигаться вперед, ночью на него внезапно напало из засады ужасное безумное существо, использовавшее ужасающую магию и саму манию, чтобы разгромить его армию. Однако он отказался бежать и вместо этого бросился на существо сквозь адское пламя и поток безумия. Однако его удар не достиг цели, и он был сражен ими.\nДжайиндра умер бы там, если бы не поразил другого человека, наблюдавшего за ним.\n\nЧеловек, который объял Джайиндру, немедленно применил свои навыки на практике. Служа дипломатом и генералом, Джайиндра регулярно и успешно сражался в Вечной войне, но часто из-за своего недовольства начальством он постоянно ссорился со своим сиром. Итак, когда до кшатриев дошла весть о экспансии Великого монгольского улуса и о собственном походе [Glossary('Анда','podgloss.anda')], Чандрапутра отправил Джайиндру в качестве посланника и военного советника.\nПо мнению Джайиндры, это было к лучшему, так как он хотел сменить темп борьбы с Голодными мертвецами.

Однако даже в детстве в ней явно горела бунтарская жилка, то самое пламя, которое однажды изменит ее навсегда.\nНачав с мелочей, таких как мамины ленты для волос и обувь деревенского мастера, она поднималась все выше и выше, пока не добилась самого высокого результата, когда, пробравшись в храм, который считался заброшенным, украла нефритовый талисман, охраняемый стариком, который превратился в демона и сбежала так быстро, как только позволяли ноги, она убегала с места кражи. Когда она скрылась в своей родной деревне, то вздохнула с облегчением. Но она действительно сделала это, потому что после этого демоны ворвались в деревню, разыскивая ее. Поэтому она использовала все свои воровские навыки, чтобы скрыться в дикой местности, но была остановлена кем-то, кто на самом деле преследовал её по пятам.\nДругой вор предложил обучить её и сделать так, чтобы она стала лучше, чем могла мечтать.

Родившаяся во время упадка и, в конечном счете, краха династии Хань, Цзянь увидела и испытала на собственном опыте, каково это - жить в распадающейся империи. У ее родной деревни отобрали все продовольствие, а когда ее отец и братья, чтобы прокормиться, занялись разбоем, их схватили полевые командиры и предали смерти. Когда жители деревни возмутились убийством и намеренно попытались сделать акцент на том, что они никогда не нападали на своих правителей, военачальник приказал сжечь всю деревню. Выжили очень немногие, но среди них была Цзянь. Все это испытание глубоко настроило ее, и она решила уничтожить военачальников и империю, из-за которых ее семья была убита, а дом разрушен.\n\nВместе со своей названой сестрой Чжэн они отправились в путь. Однако это был небольшой отряд, известный только тем, что женщины командовали разбойниками, и когда они потерпели поражение в битве с Цао Пи, их немедленно приговорили к смерти.\nНо был кто-то, кто присматривал за ними обоими. После особенно жестокой схватки с тюремным стражником Цзянь проснулась от крика, когда трёхглазая фигура открыла ее камеру. Существо, Цзао-Си, подбежало к ней и объяло в Ву Цзао. Однако Цзянь была в ярости. Этот претенциозный вор читал ей нотации, убил ее, стоял в стороне, когда ее калечили, и позволил всему злу в мире свершиться.\nПри первой же возможности они вместе с Чжэн, которая была обращена таким же образом, скрылись в ночи. В своих странствиях они встретили другого странника, который выбрал путь, близкий к их собственному, из мира без богов и хозяев.

Из суматохи своей жизни Чжэн усвоила этот урок. Чжэн, родившаяся в маленькой деревушке на севере Китая в период упадка династии Хань, делала все возможное, чтобы прокормить свою общину, в то время как местные военачальники выжимали из нее все, что могли. Однако этому не суждено было сбыться, так как несколько других жителей деревни, чтобы выжить, обратились к разбою, и в результате ужасной цепочки событий, однажды, когда она была на охоте, она вернулась в свою деревню, спасаясь бегством в горы, когда она поднялась на вершину холма и увидела, что он охвачен пламенем. Охваченная ужасом и яростью, она решила взять в руки лук и любой ценой восстановить справедливость в своем разрушенном доме. Итак, она присоединилась к одной из выживших, Цзянь, в её собственной яростной кампании против ханьцев.\nОднако, несмотря на то, что Чжэн хорошо знала этот регион, они были небольшой группой бандитов, выступавших против растущего могущества Цао Пи. У них не было ни единого шанса, и, попав в плен, Чжэн была приговорена к смерти. Внутренне разбитая, она ждала этого, переживая последние несколько дней с монотонностью робота. Однажды ночью, после особенно жестокого поворота событий с одним из стражников, в её узилище ворвался трехглазый мужчина, и, к большому ужасу Чжэн, он убил её и воскресил в виде вампира.\nЧжэн была в невероятном ужасе. Она хотела умереть, ее дом был разрушен, ее дело разрушено, а теперь у нее украли саму жизнь. И у ее убийцы хватило наглости назвать это даром, а затем наказать ее за горе.

Сати была захвачена в плен во время налёта и удостоилась сомнительной чести, в основном потому, что благодаря своей матери она немного говорила на ломаном русском, быть избранной для обращения, чтобы обучать свою новую хозяйку-нежить обычаям своего народа.\n\nСати занималась этим пару лет, прежде чем ее сир почти забыла о ней, у которой не было никаких дальнейших планов на её счет. Однажды ночью, когда Сати ушла, никто ее не остановил и даже не заметил.\nНесмотря на то, что юная вентру была едва сведуща в вопросах вампиризма, она знала, что по всей России и дальше на запад водятся монстры, еще более могущественные, чем её собственная дама. Однако она вспомнила, что в ее маленьком племени лактан, похоже, никогда не было ни одного такого вампира, и поэтому решила выследить их. Пребывание в знакомой обстановке без других вампиров показалось ей лучшим решением.\n\nК ее удивлению, план Сати сработал, учитывая все обстоятельства. Она нашла остатки своего племени и, используя свои новые способности, была легко принята обратно.\nВ последующие годы Сати впервые начала наслаждаться жизнью (или нежизнью), используя свое влияние, чтобы поддержать свое племя, защитить себя от других и попытаться обуздать его худшие наклонности.\n\nКогда орда [Glossary('Анда','podgloss.anda')], следуя за монголами, послала эмиссаров к меньшим племенам (включая ее племя) требуя подчинения или смерти, Сати обнаружила, что впервые за многие годы разговаривает с другими повелителями нежити. Она сделала единственный разумный выбор и преклонила колено перед могущественными захватчиками, спасая свой народ от полного уничтожения.\nСейчас она ждет в своем маленьком уголке степи, надеясь, что она и ее народ переживут продолжающийся шторм."

Not just through a son or husband, but in her own name. And then in a string of poor choices and political winds, she was removed from power in the twilight of her life, and died after years of struggling against illness.\nBut that is not where her path ended. And for upending her place as a concubine turned Emperor, the Hell of Upside Down Sinners awaited her. \n\nAfter her entire life of struggle, the madness of the Hell shattered her and remade her a thousand times in the agony of that Hell. Millennia in moments, a moment in decades, a throne of paupers, a dumpster of crowns, armies of pacifists, unhampered sages, lies in truths, plummets only a single step and single steps a fall from the heavens.\nEvery worry made centuries of trauma, every doubt a paralysis of terror. And a realization. And once she realized, she couldn't stop. And in a moment, begged to go home.\n\nSo the master of the Hell sent her back to the world of the Living, awake in her tomb with still lungs, a rejuvenated body, and all that she had learned. And a rage that was beyond her body to contain.\n\nWu was found by the [kuei_jin|E], and with her anger, she was sent to the Devil Tigers. The anger in her became a crucible. To see all she accomplished, all she did rendered to a blank monument, on top of the suffering she endured became a white hot crucible of vengeance.\nShe would make a new greatness, a masterpiece of spite and she would take power on her own terms without kneeling.

Many of the Hungry Dead seek it, but few tend to the land that leads there.  One of the lucky few who would be content would be the venerable Tenzing, Keeper of Shigatse. However, as the winds from the north begin to howl, he has found himself forced to action.\n\nTenzing was born during the decline of the Yarlung Dynasty, surrounded by the chaos that naturally comes with an empire in decline. While most of his homeland was thrown into panic with the assassination of King Darma U Dum Tsen, Tenzing saw in that chaos space to profit. Transforming his small village into a supposed 'refuge' he would actually pay thugs to assault and kill people on their way to safety at choice mountain passes, using the chaos of the age as cover.\nHe became fabulously wealthy, but that did little to protect him when during this Era of Fragmentation one of the survivors of the raid managed to uncover his treachery, kidnapped him, and left him to die of exposure in the Himalayas and send his soul hurtling into the Hell of Being Skinned Alive.\n\nThe experience was intensely sobering, as Tenzing was stripped of all that he had and that he was. While he did eventually escape, he became an ascetic, detesting wealth and devoting himself to learning. He would rise among the Shigatse monks, and proposed numerous critical theories and would spearhead their demon hunts.\nHowever, when Fan retired and Da assumed leadership of the White Tiger Court, the fool had the audacity to try and push deeper oversight on the Shigatse Monks. As such, they rejected Da's pleas for aid when the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] began to gnaw on the Court, and Tenzing, the leader of the monks at the time, watched as it crumbled. But now, Tenzing moves once more into chaos, seeking to rebuild the White Tiger Court into something more as what the Shigatse envisioned when they joined.\nAll he must do is succeed where he had once failed, and thrive in the chaos.\n\nFuture Fate\nThe Shigatse Monks, while strong, were too isolated to do much to oppose the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')].

Fu Hao stood out among her husband's wives as a capable and intelligent leader, with a brilliant mind for military matters. She would rise through them, eventually become Wu Ding's second wife, priestess, and a military officer and general, holding land in her own name.\nHer campaigns elevated her to Wu Ding's greatest general at the command of his largest army, and while she did die before her husband, she was buried with honors within his capital.\n\nBut for Fu Hao, she awoke from death in Lanka, made a devil for her conquests.

One of them bought it, and once she had internalized it, she immediately fled back to her home, where she shared the arts with her Court.\n\nFuture Fate\nKalinaw's stunt would not do the Violet Court many favors, but Piyau's own ascension at least gave them breathing room, as the formation of the Quincunx was a far greater issue.\nKalinaw would become one of the foremost experts on Flesh Shintai outside of the Golden Courts, and later on, would become a critical part of countering the Fleshcrafted monstrosities of the Blood Mage Cainites who would one day later establish themselves and dominate the Philippines."

When he discovered the true horror at the heart of it, he would challenge it directly, and while it would slay him, Makisig would buy the Night World of East Asia precious centuries of peace from Kagaseo, as he would become the first being to force her into [torpor|E], proving to the Night World that even the Hand of the Iron Tyrant can be beaten, and deny her followers her presence for over two centuries."

While many would consider her quite bold for claiming that name, she embodies the Goddess she believes saved her as close as she can. A tempest of rage and destruction, unflinching in the face of danger, devoted to her new family and cause without question, and a delight in death, she certainly looks the part in battle. But before all that, she cannot say, for it no longer exists.\nSome Godlings suspect she may have been a Mage of Time in life before she somehow destroyed herself and her past, hence why she escaped the Hell of Wicked Magic. And her death in some way stripped her of all power, until, by rage and divine illumination, she tore her way out not with magic but with raw anger and strength.

No matter the dedication of her meditations or focus she placed upon them, she was always plagued with uncertainy, fear, and melancholy. So she died young, at her own hands. And to that torment, she found her way into the Hell of Bitter Truth, one tailor made to strip the faithful of cause and devotion, and trick them into worshipping its master.\n\nBut so broken by devotion, she instead resolved to make her own way. In faithlessness, she found her purpose. Something awoke in her, and she would manage to fight her way out. And when found by the Faces of the Goddess, her accomplishment in navigating through one of the deepest hells back to the living without invention made her take the title of Bhuvaneshvari.\n\nAnd to that end, she now manages both their earthly and spiritual affairs. Not a fighter but a navigator, she prefers to shy away from combat, tending to coin and resources instead. She maps out realms for the Godlings to use, sends out envoys, and organizes the youngest Godlings to those ends.\nHowever, a doubt always remains.

And to that end, Chinnamasta, summoning all the will she had, overcame the power of the vitae to instead throw herself off the pedestal that was prepared for herself, and decapitated herself on a saw rather than be used to that end.\n\nAnd it seemed that within Lanka she was set to be made to be eternally regretful for having the audacity to defy them.

There was no one left in that small segment of Lanka but her, as all before her had been absolved, and simply opened her eyes broken and bleeding in the world of the living.

But her services as a medium at least made her tolerated, and she died peacefully, and for a time, went to the Hell of Wretched Magic for her lack of drive in laying the dead to rest.\nHowever, she took this too in stride, and used the isolation put upon her and made it the means of her escape. And when found by Shodashi, Shodashi initially wrote her off, but then noticed how incredibly wise the old woman was, and what they understood as a piece of Shakti in her. So, the old woman was taken in and given the name she would go by into the Night World, Dhumavati.\n\nDhumavati at least nominally is tasked with dealing with the dead, but in truth, she is the main source of conversation among young Godlings and the Descended from the Faces of the Goddess.

Enjoying catching fish to watch them suffocate, drowning rabbits, knocking dogs into crocodile infested waters, and slaughtering sacred animals.

The pain of drowning and hell of it on repeat, forced to suffer the same fate she inflicted on others, at the very least humbled her, to an extent at least.\n\nAnd when she finally escaped Hell by letting herself be a canvas of pain until she was thrown back into the living, she at least felt she needed to temper her... 'indulgences'. With a part of the Shakti within her, she might be better.\n\nAt least, Bagalā tries. That taste for murder is still in her. But poisons of paralysis, traps, silver knives, stakes, and many other implements of murder she now just... better chooses her targets. Ravnos, [akuma|E], Nagaraja, Devils, and many an assortment of the wicked are introduced to Bagalā's attention, where she takes a special glee in hacking them to pieces and making a show of their death.\n\nWhile a far cry from the Devi that is her namesake, she at the very least is useful to the Faces of the Goddess.

Her parents in a similar profession, she had little else she could hope to achieve past that.\nSo, from a young age, she took to the same profession, and did so diligently. But the derision she felt as someone who disposed of the dead was something that never left her. And one night, things got infinitely worse when, as she was burying one body, they began twitching, rising back from the earth. She panicked, the existential fear of death gripping her as the recently risen corpse beat her to death, ate her, and left her bones and tendons rotting in the sun.\nAnd after the sin of being murdered by a Risen, she wound herself in the Hell of Burrowing Maggots. But despite it all, her former source of isolation became a thing of liberation. Knowing how bodies rot and how the dead decay allowed her to time the maggot cycles, and used the flies blooming from her body to carry her back to the living world.\n\nSince becoming a student of Shodashi and taking the name Matangi to always remind her of her origins, Matangi cannot help but notice even now, despite being called a Godling, she is still on the periphery of her new Courts.\nAt the very least, she has accepted her role as a Goddess of Outcastes, protecting them from fates like hers.

As for the why, when her betrothed found out, he had simply drowned her, and then took a sister as a bride.\n\nThus, condemned to the Hell of Boiling Seas for adultery and drowning, her only companion other than suffocation was the currents. So, rather than risk the flaming surface, she followed the current in the Hells. And in going through it and trusting the flow, she did find herself extradited back to the world of the Living.\n\nAnd when found by the Faces of the Goddess, her competence and skill in governance made her incredibly valuable, and she was an easy choice for the final student of Shodashi.

Waking up being eaten apart, she had once lived a life of comfort and she was now confined to horror. Panicking, her wails and screaming was enough that she caught the attention of the Bright Forest Xiaoli, who pulled her from the Hell and brought her back to the Black Tortoise. And when they conversed, Xiaoli was impressed by her understanding of warfare, and insisted to the rest of the Bright Forests that they defy convention and include Lìn among their numbers.\n\nLìn was fast friends with Xiaoli, and she got along quite well with the rest of them. Her husband's campaign notes were known to her, and applying his stratagems were critical to the Black Tortoise Court consolidating its victory against the [akuma|E] before Dokhor Khan and the threat of the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')]. Resting on her laurels, Lìn was proud to retire simply supporting Pu Shoukeng, playing board games with Xiaoli, and pursuing her own enlightenment.\n\nHowever, her younger age spurred a good deal of issues with the Yellow Emperor Court, especially Li, Wang Hongben's Northern Emissary. Lìn and Li quickly came to despise each other, a hatred and fury that would bloom into the constant border skirmishes that plague the Courts. Even now, she is more focused on Li than the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')], as she pursues every attempt to humiliate the bastard that continually demeans her as nothing more than 'a Barbarian's Whore', adamant to prove her own worth against them."

Surrounded by the early [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] and Fera, Rong earned a reputation as an unbeatable force that could break any before him. He was the one that would drive the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] from the main places the Black Tortoises would build, and the force of strength that would ensure the Siberakh would remain too isolated to ever join with the other shapeshifters.\nPu Shoukeng would become a close friend of his, as his elevated perspective helped give Rong direction. He would become the protector of the Bright Forests, and the rock in which they would build their Empire.\n\nBut now, the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] are ascendant under the Mongol Empire and [akuma|E] run rampant. And Rong is long out of practice, and without allies beyond his [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')]. Rong came to hate the impudence of the greater political actors among the Black Tortoise Court, antagonizing Tarugha, Tan Banshi, and Xiang Li for their political ambition, and his own disinterest in any romantic paths made him closed off as access to Pu Shoukeng's Court.\n\nHe was simply too focused on service, and in the heavily political and informal structure of the courts spelled issues for him on a large scale. And as he may need help against the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')], that stance may very well have damned him once again."

The first leader of one of the oldest [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')] of the Steppe, from the early days of the Fourth Age to the present. But now, she is a shell of the feared terror that the Steppe Beast Courts once whispered about, and as she watches destruction approach, she seems ever more locked into her depression.\n\nBadmaraag was one of the most beautiful woman of her tribe when she lived, the favorite consort of a chieftain. But, in many ways she was still seen as 'defective' for her blindness.\nBut she still did her duty as a consort well, bearing him many children, and when the Wheel of Ages turned and the Time of Beautiful Sadness began, Badmaraag had died in childbirth delivering her 13th Child and went to the [Glossary('Hell of Spiked Chains','podgloss.hellspikedchains')].\nBut she knew how to exploit the politics it mocked, so she escaped in short order. And on her escape, tutored by the earlier savants of these early ages, she went with likeminded souls north, to be free of the restrictions of the Court in the Chinese core of their society.\n\nAnd despite her blindness, her new ability to see souls and spirits alongside her own much more practiced senses, she became the greatest of the Steppe Hungry Dead in terms of hunting prowess, choosing to hunt all rival members of the Beast Court that threatened them.\n\nBut millennia of violence will wear anyone down. Fighting with Xiaoli on politics and the endless struggle against the misogynist Achibaatar and the brutality of Tugmandakh has led her to largely withdraw and focus on enlightenment. She has found a friend among the young [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')], and taking her first and only student Khorkhoi is a kind of insurance.\nShe knows the Black Tortoise Court is doomed, but there are places that need to be guarded. So for that end, as the Hunters stagnate, she puts her faith in new blood.\n\nFuture Fate\nBadmaraag's experience from centuries of struggle finally reached a breakthrough in taking a student, and as the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] were knocking on her Haven, they found it empty, as she had just ascended to the [Glossary('Hundred Clouds','podgloss.hundredclouds')] moments before, finally free"

As a girl, she was the only child of the leader of a small group of steppe nomads, and she had long desired to follow in his glory. And while the circumstances of fate would see her dead before him, she never gave up that dream, even when she was consigned to the [Glossary('Hell of Spiked Chains','podgloss.hellspikedchains')].\n\nPaying no mind to how her lust for power and prestige may have interfered with her soul's fate, Gatlmaa thrashed against the Hell, and in her protests and fury at the world, she broke herself free and escaped back to the living world. With enough pride to choke a whale to death and a desire for everything and all things, she took the risk of opportunity on the steppe over the security in the Yellow Emperor Court.\n\nPerhaps the least 'regretful' of the Regretful Hunters, she chased every glory she could, and was the strongest pusher for chasing and absorbing tribes into their network of influence, becoming a hidden lord and general, using various tribes and camps as pieces on a board for her own mock games of strategy.\n\nNaturally, this glory chaser with all the restraint of a starving dog, patience of a hummingbird, and humility of a demon found few friends. Her own [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')] barely tolerated her, naked antagonism with the other founding [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')], routinely getting her Dhampyr killed, and usual solution of fighting someone by setting entire fields ablaze, is largely alone as she continues to chase more and more glory."

Routine border clashes, seeking the hidden Siberian dragons, and dealing with the distorted and mangled essence flowing through the Great Wall, they have for the most part accepted that their actions would have been better served elsewhere.\n\nSo that is why Chinzorig runs from his past.\n\nAn oddity for having come from the Hell of [Glossary('Kakuri','podgloss.kakuri')], Chinzorig however was a capable hunter, honed in searching for scraps. His tracking skill was essential for the success of the Regretful Hunters, as he was the supreme and uncontested master at finding Dragon Nests and, as the Beast Courts called them, 'Caerns'.\n\nAnd with the forces of the early Court, many of their now oldest fonts were found and won by him. But he was too greedy in his search, and now the relationship with the Beast Courts remains ever broken. Chinzorig has reacted to this regret by refusing to live in the past, instead now chasing any conflict he can bury his head in.\n\nBut now, Chinzorig is poking the bear. In his focused flight from guilt, he pokes at the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.Anda')], and rather blatantly. Clashing with them early on as the rest of the Court entertains itself with drama, Chinzorig has already lost numerous students to a team of [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] riders.\n\nYounger [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')] despise him as the pinnacle of foolishness, and as the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] grow closer, he may very well have set the domino to doom the Black Tortoise Court."

A pastoralist in life with his death caused by lean times, the trauma of the Hell of No Money, and his own escape caused Khongor to become something new and something far deadlier. However, his soul remains unchanged. What he was in life, he will be in death, just in a new context.\n\nKhongor is the main emissary to the mortal groups on the Steppes from the Regretful Hunters to the various nomad clans and tribes. He has both prepped good people to feed from and the means for their own security.\n\nHaving spent a large degree of time with Nesulte, who was once an ally that became the mother to his Dhampyr children, he kept pushing on with his meager tasks despite criticisms from other members of the ancient [Glossary('Wu','podgloss.wu')]. But he pays them little mind, further inflaming their distrust of him.\nHe has even taken on a new student, Sansar, who he has as a close confiding friend and ally.\n\nBut things are getting far more grim than Khongor is ready for. The [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] press closer, and many of his tribes defect and join with the rest of the Great Mongol Nation or being destroyed outright, providing him with fewer and fewer allies. And as the [Glossary('Anda','podgloss.anda')] breathe down the Black Torstoise Court's neck, his gentleness may prove to be his undoing."
