 POD_podlore.100.desc.POD_fae_character_250: "Два столетия назад сын Рагнельф и Свейна Вилобородого решил попробовать свои силы в управлении смертными. Известный как Кнуд Великий, он правил империей Северного моря, состоявшей из Англии, Дании и Норвегии, до 1034 года. Чтобы править новообращённым (по меркам фей) в христианскую веру населением, Кнуд изучил ритуалы и предания этой веры. Он слишком хорошо подражал благочестивым людям и в конце концов присоединился к делу Константинианцев, хотя Зима и предстала перед ним в образе короля викингов-грабителей, одержимого жаждой завоеваний. Момент его обращения описан в рассказе «Канут и прилив». Король установил свой трон на берегу моря и приказал приливу остановиться, чтобы не намочить ноги и одежды. Он попытался сотворить могущественное заклинание для этого на глазах у истинно верующих... его магия дала сбой. Волна продолжала подниматься, как обычно, и захлестывала его ступни, не обращая внимания на его царственную особу. Кнуд отскочил назад со словами: «Пусть все люди знают, как пуста и никчёмна власть королей, ибо нет никого достойнее этого имени, кроме Того, кому небо, земля и море подчиняются по вечным законам». Затем он повесил свою золотую корону на распятие и никогда больше не надевал её, чтобы восславить Бога, всемогущему царя. Устав от жестокого и смертельного правления, он инсценировал свою смерть и вернулся в дом Асов, чтобы распространять константинианскую веру в доме своих предков."

Для многих это было ужасно - быть изгнанным из своего дома. Но для Батбайбара он не мог быть счастливее. С юности Батбайбар высоко ценил искусство. Начав с изготовления луков и оперения, он предпочитал проводить время за ткачеством гобеленов и резьбой по дереву, а не за охотой. Он был настолько поглощён своим искусством, что, когда на его общину напали, один воин вломился в его юрту, чтобы убить его, битва проиграна, но он был настолько погружён в своё ремесло, что даже не заметил этого. Ему удалось спастись, и он бежал на юго-запад, в сторону Иранского нагорья. Там он был очарован их работами и с энтузиазмом демонстрировал своё мастерство ремесленника. Именно здесь он привлёк внимание Бану Хаким и был принят в их ряды в качестве одного из визирей.\n\nБатбайбар - это картина творческого безумия, охватившего визирей. Но теперь его творчеству помешали. По мере того, как монголы продвигаются вглубь Ирана, он приходит в ужас от разрушений, которые несут некоторые из их полководцев. И, что ещё хуже, Анда находятся в их тени. Батбайбар ненавидит их поход и хочет сохранить эти великие творения. Поэтому он решил держать оборону от имени клана, решив умереть, прежде чем позволит Анда уничтожить то, что он так долго защищал."

Аглайя, родившаяся среди далитов-изгнанников из Индии, путешествовавших на запад, была одной из первых из своего народа, кто увидел стены Константинополя. Сразу же ставшая нежеланной и с готовностью закованная в цепи, Навнит планировала бежать со своим народом дальше в глубь Европы, если бы ночью её не встретила женщина и не попросила обсудить с ней философию. Несмотря на то, что Навнит провела много времени в разъездах, она мечтала о родине. Она мечтала о мире, в котором она и её семья могли бы жить легко и свободно, без оков и обременений. Она говорила о местах, на которые надеялась, и сокрушалась, что если бы только у неё были силы, она бы воплотила это в жизнь.\nЖенщина решила, что из неё получилась бы идеальная бруха, когда Навнит рассказала о своём идеальном мире.\n\nС тех пор, как Навнит была обращена, она много путешествовала, ища место, где она могла бы попытаться возродить надежду своего народа, которую теперь смягчила и прояснила утопия Карфагена, о которой рассказывал ей её сир. Однако после возвышения Монгольской империи у неё появились новые возможности. Она видит в этом потенциал, место, где она может построить рай глубоко в степях, синкретизм Карфагена и святилище своей мечты для народа, который впоследствии будет называться романи."

Он обрёл свою славу, когда луланьский король Аньгуй убил нескольких дипломатов. Несмотря на то, что в то время Фу был конюхом, его послали заколоть короля, но вместо этого он предложил другой план и убил Аньгуя, одурачив его подарками и напоив, после чего его стражники немедленно избавились от короля. Фу был горд своим званием, полученным за службу, и позаботился о своей новой должности.\nНо что-то в нём оставалось. Он скучал по учёбе. Он обрёл свою славу, но что-то всё ещё не давало ему покоя. Он хотел узнать больше, он хотел учиться, и он хотел расширить свои знания.\nК своему большому удивлению, он нашёл родственную душу, которая всегда приходила по ночам, чтобы поговорить с ним о природе смерти под тяжёлыми одеяниями. В последние годы смертной жизни они были близкими друзьями. И когда он начал стареть, путешественник предложил ему дар, который позволил бы ему жить той жизнью, которую он оставил позади, в новом состоянии. Фу согласился и был объят каппадокийцем.\n\nС тех пор Фу в основном занимался своими исследованиями самостоятельно. Однако недавний всплеск смертности, вызванный ростом численности монголов, заставил его предпринять более активные действия. Монголы во многом напоминают ему Лулань из его собственной жизни, и из-за того, что они причиняют огромное беспокойство мертвым, он решил действовать. В конце концов, он всегда хотел быть чем-то большим, чем просто книжным червем. И что такое второй король, если его уже можно так легко убить?"

С самого рождения его жизнь в степях была постоянной борьбой. Вечно больной, с открытой неприязнью относившийся к своим товарищам, Темюлен всегда был в стороне и открыто высмеивался остальными членами своей большой семьи. В то время как его семья участвовала в налётах по Европе, он часто был слишком слаб физически, чтобы правильно пользоваться луком, и поэтому в таких походах к нему относились как к бесполезному существу.\nОднако во время одного из вторжений они совершили ошибку, напав не на ту церковь. Ночью в темноте произошел взрыв, поглотивший всех, кто находился внутри. Темюлен бежал изо всех сил, и та ночь стала худшей и последней в его жизни. Несмотря на невозможное, он встретил это так, как всегда. Борясь перед лицом невозможного и отказываясь сдаться и умереть. И это произвело впечатление на нападавшего, который затем объял Темюлена в клан Ласомбра.\nЕго «воспитание» лишь укрепило волю Темюлена к выживанию, но также и его ненависть. Больше всего на свете Темюлен ненавидел систему, которая всегда считала его слабым. А теперь он силен. Для смертных он как бог, и он наслаждается чувством объективного превосходства, которое он теперь имеет над ними. Он наслаждается короной тьмы, возложенной на его голову, и больше ничего не хочет, чтобы сделать ее вечной, чтобы показать всем, кто отверг его, что он силен."

Гобелены, музыка, скульптуры, картины, музыкальные инструменты, архитектура и бесчисленное множество других видов искусства, как физического, так и эмоционального, являются обычным делом. Но Отгонбаяр видит в хорошо воспитанном животном гораздо больше красоты, чем просто в картине.\nВ смертной жизни Отгонбаяр была главным помощником своего клана по уходу за лошадьми и домашним скотом. Каждая пара была её выбором, и она испытывала огромное удовлетворение, наблюдая, как стада и поголовье скота её клана улучшаются в течение нескольких поколений. И так великолепен был ее собственный чистокровный конь, что во время торговой поездки в город ночная фигура была настолько очарована ее работой, что они не могли позволить такой художнице умереть, прежде чем она успеет создать свой шедевр.\nВ целом, объятия не сильно изменили Отгонбаяр, потому что теперь у нее есть все время, чтобы совершенствоваться в науках и искусстве. Ее собственные стада являются одними из лучших в мире, и на протяжении веков спаривание контролировалось для получения идеального потомства. Однако, глядя на свои прекрасные стада, она хочет перейти к следующему шагу. Она оглядывается на людей, которые ее окружают, и, возможно, задается вопросом, можно ли в это время раздора сделать то же самое с человеком..."

Однако во время путешествия их проводник-тремер встретил окончательную смерть, и Дельта вместе со своим выводком отвела их в безопасное место на Урале, прежде чем отправиться дальше на восток.\nТеперь, освободившись от уз крови и сбежав со своими заклятыми спутниками, Дельта ревностно охраняет их новую свободу. Мир ночи в степях - это хаос, и они обладают уникальными навыками выживания в этих регионах, благодаря своим крыльям и способности сливаться с землей. Но еще больше она боится, что тремеры будут искать эту потерянную кладку, независимо от того, насколько напрасными будут их поиски. Поэтому она ревниво охраняет их общее убежище, охотясь вместе и никогда не расставаясь. И по мере того, как хаос Анда приближается, она вынуждена делать выбор.\nОни продолжат прятаться?

Отправленная со своей стаей на Восток, она освободилась после смерти их наставника-тремера во время вторжения монголов, и, поскольку ей больше некуда было идти, она держалась поближе к Дельте, уходя с ней все глубже в степи.\nОмега - сердце своей стаи, но, прежде всего, она наиболее фанатично предана Дельте. Помимо того, что она была защитницей Омеги в ямах гаргулий, Дельта позволяла Омеге оставаться рядом. Она предана своему делу, и в отсутствие уз крови Омега все глубже погружается в объятия Дельты, чтобы ощутить еще большую ясность и защиту, которые она предлагает.\nНо Омега беспокоится за свою стаю. Поскольку Анда и другие каиниты степей окружают их, Омега умоляет Дельту построить место, где они смогут прятаться не как животные, а править так, как когда-то правили их хозяева. Она жаждет увидеть корону на голове Дельты и готова на все ради вожака своей стаи. Она просто хочет, чтобы Дельта смотрела на это так же."

Будучи сыном Шашигупты из Паропамисады, Джайиндра увидел, что его дом оказался под угрозой из-за необычайно успешного и неуравновешенного завоевателя, пришедшего с дальнего запада. Но Джайиндра всегда знал, что, когда его отец проявлял крайнюю враждебность по отношению к Александру, это не могло принести ничего хорошего. Идя против воли отца, он немедленно повел своих людей против греков, вступая с ними в бой там, где Александра не было. По большей части, он добивался успеха. Однако, когда он начал продвигаться вперед, ночью на него внезапно напало из засады ужасное безумное существо, использовавшее ужасающую магию и саму манию, чтобы разгромить его армию. Однако он отказался бежать и вместо этого бросился на существо сквозь адское пламя и поток безумия. Однако его удар не достиг цели, и он был сражен ими.\nДжайиндра умер бы там, если бы не поразил другого человека, наблюдавшего за ним.\n\nЧеловек, который объял Джайиндру, немедленно применил свои навыки на практике. Служа дипломатом и генералом, Джайиндра регулярно и успешно сражался в Вечной войне, но часто из-за своего недовольства начальством он постоянно ссорился со своим сиром. Итак, когда до кшатриев дошла весть о экспансии Великого монгольского улуса и о собственном походе Анда, Чандрапутра отправил Джайиндру в качестве посланника и военного советника.\nПо мнению Джайиндры, это было к лучшему, так как он хотел сменить темп борьбы с Голодными мертвецами. Он надеется научиться многим новым стратегиям на своем нынешнем посту, где он с нетерпением ждет, в какую сторону подует ветер."

Однако даже в детстве в ней явно горела бунтарская жилка, то самое пламя, которое однажды изменит ее навсегда.\nНачав с мелочей, таких как мамины ленты для волос и обувь деревенского мастера, она поднималась все выше и выше, пока не добилась самого высокого результата, когда, пробравшись в храм, который считался заброшенным, украла нефритовый талисман, охраняемый стариком, который превратился в демона и сбежала так быстро, как только позволяли ноги, она убегала с места кражи. Когда она скрылась в своей родной деревне, то вздохнула с облегчением. Но она действительно сделала это, потому что после этого демоны ворвались в деревню, разыскивая ее. Поэтому она использовала все свои воровские навыки, чтобы скрыться в дикой местности, но была остановлена кем-то, кто на самом деле преследовал её по пятам.\nДругой вор предложил обучить её и сделать так, чтобы она стала лучше, чем могла мечтать.

Родившаяся во время упадка и, в конечном счете, краха династии Хань, Цзянь увидела и испытала на собственном опыте, каково это - жить в распадающейся империи. У ее родной деревни отобрали все продовольствие, а когда ее отец и братья, чтобы прокормиться, занялись разбоем, их схватили полевые командиры и предали смерти. Когда жители деревни возмутились убийством и намеренно попытались сделать акцент на том, что они никогда не нападали на своих правителей, военачальник приказал сжечь всю деревню. Выжили очень немногие, но среди них была Цзянь. Все это испытание глубоко настроило ее, и она решила уничтожить военачальников и империю, из-за которых ее семья была убита, а дом разрушен.\n\nВместе со своей названой сестрой Чжэн они отправились в путь.

После особенно жестокой схватки с тюремным стражником Цзянь проснулась от крика, когда трёхглазая фигура открыла ее камеру. Существо, Цзао-Си, подбежало к ней и объяло в Ву Цзао.

Этот претенциозный вор читал ей нотации, убил ее, стоял в стороне, когда ее калечили, и позволил всему злу в мире свершиться.\nПри первой же возможности они вместе с Чжэн, которая была обращена таким же образом, скрылись в ночи. В своих странствиях они встретили другого странника, который выбрал путь, близкий к их собственному, из мира без богов и хозяев.

From the tumult of her life, that is the lesson that Zheng internalized. Born in a small village in Northern China during the decline and collapse of the Han Dynasty, Zheng did her best to provide for her community as a hunter, while the local warlords squeezed it dry of all they could. However, such was not to be, as several other members of the village turned to banditry to survive, and in a horrible chain of events, one day as she was out hunting, she returned to several of her village fleeing into the mountains, as she crested a hill and saw it aflame. Horrified and furious, she resolved to pick up her bow and get justice, no matter the cost, for her destroyed home. So, she joined one of the other survivors, Jiang, in her own zealous campaign against the Han.\nHowever, despite Zheng's own familiarity with the region, they were a small mass of bandits against the growing power of Cao Pi. They never stood a chance, and captured, Zheng was condemned to death. Internally shattered, she awaited it going from her last few days with a robotic monotony. One night after a particularly brutal affair with one of the guards, a three eyed man broke into her cell, and much to Zheng's horror, they killed her and brought her back as a vampire.\nZheng was horrified beyond belief. She wanted to die, her home was gone, her cause destroyed, and now her very life stolen from her. And her killer had the audacity to call it a gift, and then punish her for her grief. So she ran with her friend from her mortal life, looking for something, anything to fill the void in her empty heart. It wasn't until she met a wandering foreigner from Japan, who strove for a society in the night with no lords, and no masters that she found a fire once more. One that she now desperately wants to keep burning."

Sati was captured during the raid and had the dubious honor, mostly because she could speak some broken Russian thanks to her mother, of being chosen for the embrace to teach her new undead mistress about the ways of her people.\n\nSati did just that for a couple of years before being mostly forgotten by her Sire who never had plans for her beyond that point. When Sati left one night, nobody stopped her or even noticed.\nWhile she had been barely educated in vampiric matters, the young Ventrue did know that there were monsters of even more power than her own Sire all over Russia and further west. However, she remembered that her small Laktan tribe never seemed to have one such vampire in their midst and thus decided to track them down. Being in a familiar environment without any other vampires around seemed like the best course of action.\n\nAlmost to her surprise, Sati's plan worked well all things considered. She found the remnants of her tribe and, using her new powers, was easily accepted back.\nIn the years that followed, Sati started enjoying life (or unlife) for the first time as she used her influence to bolster her tribe, keep her safe from others and try to curb its worst tendencies.\n\nWhen the Anda Horde, following the Mongols, sent emissaries to the smaller tribes (including hers) to ask for subservience or death, Sati found herself talking to other undead lords for the first time in years. She made the only rational choice and bent the knee to the powerful invaders, sparring her people from utter destruction.\nShe now waits in her small corner of the steppes, hoping that she and her people will survive the ongoing storm."

But unfortunately, it was not meant to be.\n\nBai was maddeningly cautious, lethargic, and overly deferential to Wang. His own eccentricities were even enhanced by Bai, who only wanted what her liege commanded.

And to that end, she is usually always eager to listen to Wang for the sake of more of it.\n\nQing never feels more alive punishing sinners, to new and horrifying extremes that even other Devil Tiger elders will gag before her works of art. And she is not discriminating, as she often asks Wang if there are any 'sinners' that need punishing.

He would rise among the Shigatse monks, and proposed numerous critical theories and would spearhead their demon hunts.\nHowever, when Fan retired and Da assumed leadership of the White Tiger Court, the fool had the audacity to try and push deeper oversight on the Shigatse Monks. As such, they rejected Da's pleas for aid when the Anda began to gnaw on the Court, and Tenzing, the leader of the monks at the time, watched as it crumbled. But now, Tenzing moves once more into chaos, seeking to rebuild the White Tiger Court into something more as what the Shigatse envisioned when they joined.\nAll he must do is succeed where he had once failed, and thrive in the chaos.\n\nДальнейшая судьба\nThe Shigatse Monks, while strong, were too isolated to do much to oppose the Anda. But while most of the other exiles fled East, he ordered they go to ground and fortify the Himalayas against the Anda.\nTenzing would simply retire to his research after that final order, to dedicate himself once more to his research on the Defiled and Half-Devils."

And as Wu Ding died, his warrior wife paid him one last final visit, ensuring she would be there no matter what.\nAnd when he moved onto whatever came next, she joined the society of the Wan Kuei with deference and respect.\n\nFu Hao's military experience, temperance, diligence, and unflinching resolve in battle brought her into the sphere of Fan, where the large and daunting woman accepted a place within their Wu as their warrior. A study of the Ten Seasons Sect and cold resolve gave her a foundational position in Fan's court, and when she retired, Fu tried to respect her wishes and knelt to Da. But when the Anda began to arrive and she tried to rally an army, Da refused to send her men, leading to several Courts being sacked.\nTolerating it no longer, she broke from the Courts and rallied a host of her own, setting the dissolution of the Court into motion.

Despite the good deed, he was caught however, and killed by the would be father for denying him his 'claim' over his victim, locking him in a box and burying him alive after knocking him unconscious.\nAnd Sengdeuane would be cursed to the Night Realms. And there, he cursed the world endlessly for its cruelty, begging for some means to shatter it and grind it away as he howled in that insensate plain.

And for an unfathomable time to him, finally, he had enough scraps to crawl free. But the first to find him was the Serpent Sovereign, who recognized the intellect he had and took him in. He offered him a place he could actually use his mind, manage all the coin and trade of a new world, have the comfort of a liege who would protect him, and a lover who would never abandon him.\nOudom, having endured the shame of poverty made hell, simply never wanted to suffer that, and readily accepted."

And they must be ready.\n\nДальнейшая судьба\nMutawuta would enable the northern Chinese Wan Kuei to unite against the Anda, his missives reaching all the right ears.\nHowever, his skill and reputation would make him threatening, and in time, he will be assassinated among the Quincunx, supposedly by the Dhampyr that once respected him, their father ordering this threat to them removed."

While it is true it is helpful, not everyone prefers to fight on horseback, and some are just as dangerous as a mounted horseman on foot.\nAmong the Hebei Warriors, Mapo is proof of that claim. The beast of a man with his axe is feared among the Wan Kuei of the north, his reputation and appetite for destruction preceding him.\n\nBut in life, his story was far less eventful. The spare son after the heir to a Jurchen chieftain, Mapo was a quiet, heavy, and shy kid.\nHe initially hated fighting, and largely was afraid of hurting others. And even as an adult, he was quite reclusive, and instead managed resources. But an accident while out riding led to Mapo's death, drowning in a river after a strike to the head. And in the Hell of Boiling Seas, being a bloated buoy for what felt like centuries was agony, before a Wan Kuei saved him and brought him to Maedaeri for training.\n\nScared of being weak again, Mapo took to fighting like a fish to water. His hunger for battle and sustenance grew, until he became the titan he is now. Often, he is the muscle in Maedaeri's court, the one people think of when they hear of the Warriors of Hebei.\n\nДальнейшая судьба\nMapo would ride with Maedaeri when she set into motion the destruction of the Anda. But much to his dismay, she demanded he stay and guarded their homes in case she failed.\nWhen he heard of her death, he was devastated, but fought to preserve her legacy as one of the founding voices of the Quincunx."

And it is true, among their court, all are warriors. The political situation they find themselves in demands nothing less. And it makes those that die on unsafe roads from a single well placed arrow all the more tragic.\n\nSurely the whistling from afar is just the winds.\n\nSain is an enigma among the Warriors. A superbly skilled archer and falconer even among the Warriors, he is rarely ever on the front. Rather, he is always at the backline among his Wu, his well placed specialized arrows slaying numerous threats, some even said to be tipped with the venom of the Emerald Mother's assassins.\n\nSome suspect he may have even been their kin in life. But the truth of the matter is between him and Maedaeri. In truth, he is an assassin, simple and plain.\nThe visage of a warrior is a convenient face. And in times like this, the subtle arrow is the deadliest one.\n\nДальнейшая судьба\nIt is unknown what happened to Sain. Maedaeri gave him special orders to lead away an Anda deathsquad from their master's fortress.\nBut they could never find his spirit, so it is assumed he died. But in the end, he was successful in diverting the Anda's black riders from interfering in Maedaeri's gambit. Mapo is sure that if he died, he died with a smile on his face and defiance on his lips, knowing they had succeeded."

In the Pit of Salt and Iron, she was set to just more of her mortal life pushed to extremes.\nBut she was patient, and good with a whip both on her clients and on herself.

And now, she stands at a crossroads. Her mentor has grown aloof and largely left the world behind, and Akuma now run rampant.\n\nBut yet, a fellow disciple, Piyau, is more radical than even she.
