 pod1230objectives_mummy.1.t: "Ending The Snake"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.1.desc: "The eternal war between Horus and Set is just a continuation of the one between Osiris and Set and itself is just a manifestation of Balance against Entropy. It is a fundamental battle for reality itself and we were, sadly, on the losing side for a longest time.\nWhile Set and Apophis are, so far at least, out of our reach, their servants aren't. Our renewed efforts to achieve victory started this time not with the head of the snake but with its body.\n\nAnd it is showing promising results."
 pod1230objectives_mummy.1.a: "A decisive victory."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.2.t: "Land of Faith"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.2.desc: "Egypt is our home and the land where we are at our strongest thanks to the great energy, Sekhem, that we can draw from the land itself. Over the ages however, Egypt itself changed and its influence spread along a vast area and Sekhem spread with it. This gives us the opportunity to tap into this power far from our traditional home.\nAchieving control over all of the land blessed by Egypt's supernatural power will allow us to manifest powers not since since the days of the Gods and hopefully gives us a critical edge in the battles to come."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.3.t: "The Main Antagonist: Apophis"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.3.desc: "Apophis, the Serpent, has always been our most fundamental enemy. He is the very essence of entropy and factor of imbalance. Set, in many ways, was always just his willing or unwilling minion. Fighting such a primordial being has always been out of our reach and Apophis used this invulnerability to slowly corrupt balance, what we call Ma'at, and pushes the world towards oblivion.\nAs we recently won battle after battle against his minions however, we saw Apophis' hold being reduced more and more until we all received the first message from Osiris since his departure to Amenti "End this".\n\nAnd so we did.\n\nArmed with our almost infinite supply of Sekhem, we followed Anubis into the darkest corner of Oblivion and struck at the Serpent. Many of us died, but Osiris' powers made sure they came back time and time again. Some even say Isis herself appeared at the last moment to shackle Apophis for good.\n\nWhatever the truth of the matter, Apophis is no longer a threat and the world will now slowly move towards righteousness and balance as it always should have.\nAnd we will watch over it, as we always do."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.4.t: "Keeping The Roots Safe"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.4.desc: "We originate from Ancient Egypt, the land of Gods and Pharaoh, our very existence is tied to this land and our memories of it fuel our powers. But the world didn't wait and has long moved on, leaving only ruins and plundered relics of our home.\nWhile Horus might be focused on his war against Set, losing track of where we came from might destroy us more surely than any minion of the traitor. This is why we will continue to always strive to preserve Egypt's legacy, be it by safeguarding its treasures or teaching its history and culture to the newest generations."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.5.t: "Severing the Eagle's Head"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.5.desc: "Our creator, Set, has been locked into a war with Horus for generations. While his inability to destroy his opponent is concerning, you had to admit that Horus was a worthy foe. Your true master, Apophis, told you so after all.\nThe eagle headed God was the champion of Ma'at ("balance" as he saw it) and the main obstacle in the way of Apophis' triumph and gift of Oblivion to this world. With the "Avenger" now finally joining his parents into true death, the wheel turns quicker than ever..."
 pod1230objectives_mummy.5.a: "The last cry of the eagle."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.6.t: "Last Meal Before Midnight"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.6.desc: "Horus' death, while a critical blow to the "defenders of balance" had the unforeseen effect of steeling their resolve. Even those that once fought Horus too zealous and stubborn now rallied behind his name (and his cause) to try to stop you.\n\nWhich, obviously, they didn't achieve to do.\n\nStill, they made a good show of it and slowed down the ultimate victory of oblivion and Apophis for a while. But as the last of them falls, the world itself accelerates his descent into its end. Apophis has won and it is time for this wretched reality to be unmade."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.7.desc: "[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('792593').GetFirstName] has always made clear that he thinks he is the only one deserving of using the Spell of Life. As such, any Mummy not abiding to his laws had the unpleasant experience of being added to his list of enemies.\nStill, Horus is stubborn but not a fool. He knows that there are far greater threats than you to the world at large. Swaying his inner circle and displaying enough strength to make him realize that hunting you would be a costly affair have helped ease the tension somewhat. You will likely never be friend with the son of Osiris but he has at least begrudgingly accepted to leave you alone for now."
 pod1230objectives_mummy.7.a: "A ceasefire at least."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.8.t: "Ending the Avenger"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.8.desc: "[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('792593').GetFirstName] has always made clear that he thinks he is the only one deserving of using the Spell of Life. As such, any Mummy not abiding to his laws had the unpleasant experience of being added to his list of enemies.\nReasoning with a being still set on revenge after so many eras have passed is pointless. Mummies are hard to kill but not truly immortal and you took great pleasure in demonstrating that fact to the one who caused you such grief over the ages. With the son of Osiris and Isis finally joining his divine parents in the afterlife, you can rest easy and chart your own course for the future."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.9.t: "Expanding the Theourgia Arts"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.9.desc: "Mummies were created from the Ancient Egyptian Spell of Life and thus are naturally drawn to the Hekau, the Ancient Egyptian form of sorcery. Even those that weren't of this culture in their first life quickly pick up the Hekau. Still this has proven to be a point of frustration for other Mummies, like the Cabiri of Ancient Greece, who once used other forms of sorcery to great results.\nWhile efforts to rediscover how to use those have been fruitless for a long time, your recent method of gathering mortal sorcerers and their (ancient or recent) knowledge has show some promising results. While non Hekau sorcery will likely never be as easy to use for Mummies as you would like it to, it should at least be possible."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.10.t: "Securing Hades"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.10.desc: "When [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('792600').GetFirstName] first created his version of Spell of Life, he faced the issue of being unable to enter Amenti, the Ancient Egyptian realm of the dead where Mummies take the time to reconstitute themselves between each death. He as such secured a very small portion of the Shadowlands that he named "Hades" for the same use and managed to convince Charon, the leader of the Underworld, to accept this enclave, some say because of their shared Mycenaean background.\nWhatever the case may be, Hades was still a pitiful copy of Amenti and barely able to help Mummies achieve their true immortality. Thanks to your efforts however the situation has improved and Cabiri Mummies can now enjoy a more secure stay in the Underworld when the time arises."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.11.t: "From Hellas to Egypt"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.11.desc: "Mummies were created in Ancient Egypt and draw their energy, that they name Sekhem, from this land still. Cabiri Mummies, being of an offshoot created following their Mycenaean founder, don't have this luxury. This has always put them at a disadvantage as Sekhem can be used to very powerful ends by experienced Mummies.\nAs they are few in numbers and were hunted down by other supernaturals, the Cabiri never got time to properly study this issue and find a way to circumvent it. This has changed with your recent work about interacting and taking Sekhem from its source and adapting it for your own Mycenaean foundation. With this success, you have finally bridged the gap between you and the ancient followers of Horus."

As such, they feel as if it's their duty to safeguard the bounties of the previous ages before it's too late.\nKnowledge in all its forms is an important part of that effort. The [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')] will usher an age of ignorance and could push back humanity towards its savage beginnings.

Your efforts will ensure that the [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')] won't reach their throne soon and that their reign won't be met without resistance.\nEven so, you doubt that it will be enough and, in that moment of doubt, you realize that your place among the Eight Immortals can be achieved, not as a reward as you once thought, but as a duty to do even more.\nIf you wish it, your next battlefield against the forces of evil will be one of cosmic realities."

 pod1230objectives_mummy.16.t: "Achieving Ra Hekau"
 pod1230objectives_mummy.16.desc: "The old Shemsu-Heru called Ra-Hekau the supreme art of Hekau, the mastery of the world by using the True Names of everything to bend it to one's will. According to Egyptian legend, Ra-Hekau was first revealed when the Sun-God Ra gave Isis his True Name so that she could heal him from a deadly poisoning. It allowed her to become the Goddess of Magic and construct the Spell of Life.\nThey sadly soon realized that the Spell of Life was flawed and that they lost the spark of humanity that allows for this form of true magick after their first death. It has been a clear focus of some of them to try to rediscover that lost lore or a way to perfect the Spell of Life and allow for a return to this Golden Age of Mummy powers.\nWhile achieving control over Ra-Hekau itself will likely be out of their grasp still, experimenting and improving on what they know still yields incremental benefits to their current forms."
