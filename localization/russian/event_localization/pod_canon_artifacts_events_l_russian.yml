 POD_canon_artifacts.100.desc: "Вы знаете все эти истории. Оружие, которое вы носите, возможно, самое печально известное в мире. Меч Нула был создан давным-давно как вместилище для могущественного демона Драконскира в древнем Шумере. Перед тем как окончательно освободиться в мире смертных, ему помешала вампирша по имени Тиамат, которая заточила его в своём теле, а затем выбросила проклятый меч.\nС тех пор он постоянно стремится воссоединиться со своим хозяином, и большинство его владельцев, как известно, встречают безвременную смерть, если в тот или иной момент не подчиняются воле демона..."

Он неустанно гонит вас к месту упокоения своего хозяина, стараясь не дать вам уснуть даже днём. Вы идёте от опасности к опасности, будь то тёмные леса, недостаток крови или трудности поиска убежища в незнакомых землях.\nТакими темпами вы пополните длинный список жертв Меча, и вам нужно притормозить и продумать план действий, пока не стало слишком поздно."

 POD_canon_artifacts.102.desc: "Вы наконец-то приблизились к месту упокоения Драконскира и чувствуете, как Меч Нула замирает в предвкушении. Правда, есть небольшая проблема: демон покоится в лабиринте с ловушками, чтобы отпугнуть незваных гостей.\nКонечно, у вас есть Меч, поэтому вы можете просто «последовать» его чутью, чтобы избежать большинства опасностей. Но всегда есть риск свернуть не туда... Но назад дороги нет, так как вы почти уверены, что Меч нападёт на вас, если вы отступите в этот момент."

Повелитель инферналов весь в сладости и меду, благодарит вас за освобождение и обещает богатую награду за помощь.\nВы быстро понимаете, что противостоять ему уже поздно: с Мечом Нула в руке он слишком силён даже для вас, поэтому вы рассматриваете варианты.\nС одной стороны, Драконскир предлагает отдать вам содержимое сокровищницы в этой гробнице, а Меч оставить себе, очевидно, вытянув из него свою сущность. С другой стороны, демон пытается заманить вас возможностью стать его новым сосудом, обещая вечную власть, если вы будете «работать вместе»"

You see civilizations rise and fall and Cainites far older than you battling each other in unending wars...

 codex_mortis_decision_tt: "You will try to convince Titia Sabina to stand down, hopefully allowing you to learn the secrets of the book."
 
 POD_canon_artifacts.900.desc: "Some research has confirmed that the book you are holding in your hands contains the secret necromantic knowledge of the Iovanus family, most commonly known nowadays as the Giovanni. This codex was made by a rebel member of their line long before they became vampires and held by him ever since, mostly in an act of spite against the family that took everything from him.\nThis man, Aurelius Flavius Iovianus, bound the soul of his murdered wife, Titia Sabina, to the book in an effort to save her and also create powerful guardian for the codex. This effort paid off very well and you are convinced that you can't access the content of the book without Titia's approval.\nA direct conflict would be unwise as you gathered that Tinia has several $pod_Fetters$ in this world so she could easily destroy the book if you tried a hostile action against her. Shrewd diplomacy seems to be the only way forward."
