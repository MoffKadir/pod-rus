 WEAVING_THE_YOMI_WORLD_PERK_EFFECT: "Unlocks [GetBuilding('nest_corrupt_01').GetName] building.\n#F This powerful ability allows an akuma to corrupt a dragon nest, defiling it and rendering it a source of dark, evil power and woe.

 FLOOD_OF_WICKEDNESS_PERK_EFFECT: "#F Even those [GetTrait('kueijin').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] who actively study or cultivate their P'o secretly fear it. Transcendence of the P'o, even temporarily, represents a loss of control and a giving in to one's most bestial nature and desires.
