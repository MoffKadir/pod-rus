 glossary_clan_curse: "[Glossary('Clan Curse', 'glossary_clan_curse_tt')]"
 glossary_clan_curse_tt: "A Clan Curse is a supernatural limitation experienced by a $POD_splat_vampire$ based on their [Clan|E].\n\nThese deficits have a deep psychological impact on the new vampire and often force them to reshape their nightly existence completely. Various Clans, however, rationalize their Curse away. Others interpret it as a hidden gift or the secondary effect of a great enlightenment or advantage to delude themselves.\n\nAccording to the Book of Nod, the Clan Curses are the result of Caine's wrath against the [GetTrait('vampgeneration3').GetName(GetNullCharacter)] after the destruction of the [GetTrait('vampgeneration2').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."

 glossary_fera: "[Glossary('Fera', 'glossary_fera_tt')]"
 #glossary_fera_tt: "Fera, also called shifters or the Changing Breeds, are the races of therianthropic shapeshifters that inhabit the world. The term exclusively refers to those who undergo a proper First Change and excludes those who gain shapeshifting abilities via other means, such as the [Embrace|E] or [sorcery_lifestyle|E].\n\nGaia created the many breeds of fera and gave each their own role. The #TOOLTIP:GAME_TRAIT,werewolf,[GetNullCharacter] #L Garou#!#! were created to be her fangs and claws, the [GetTrait('mokole').GetName(GetNullCharacter)] as her memory, and so on. Some have lost their way with time; others were forced from their roles by the Garou during the Wars of Rage. Over time some have also turned to serving only one aspect of the Triat, instead of Gaia as a whole."
 glossary_fera_tt: "#bold Fera#! are a spiritual people with the ability to shapeshift into animal forms. $POD_splat_werewolf_plural$ are the most numerous and well-known, but there are many other kinds.\n\nAccording to Fera mythology, they were created by Gaia, the Mother Goddess of all living things, each given their own role in safeguarding her creations. However, many have strayed from their task, whether through apathy, cynicism, or bloody inter-tribe conflicts, and Gaia is growing ever more distant.\n\nThe following Fera are playable in [princes_of_darkness|E]:\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$#TOOLTIP:GAME_TRAIT,werewolf,[GetNullCharacter] #L;bold Garou#!#! #weak (Werewolves)#!\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$#bold [GetTrait('bastet').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]#! #weak (Werecats)#!"

 ####### Kuei-Jin / Asia glossary

 podgloss.dokhorkhan: "Dokhor-Khan is the [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')] of the [Glossary('Hell of Spiked Chains','podgloss.hellspikedchains')].\nAs of 1230, he is one of the most powerful [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] around and his hold over the steppes is almost uncontested. He feeds on agony and hatred and is known for his bold, sometimes reckless, plots to achieve dominance over his rivals."
 podgloss.hellspikedchains: "The Hell of Spiked Chains is a [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')] presenting itself as a vast, flat plain inhabited by the souls of mortals that have died in the steppes. Each of these souls are assigned to a tribe at random by the [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')] [Glossary('Dokhor-Khan','podgloss.dokhorkhan')], who periodically choose one of these tribes as his favoured.\nAll other tribes are stricken of one of their senses (or limbs) and have to obey the favoured tribe in all things. If they disobey, or one of the Favoured feels like it, they are put to the tortures of the Spiked Chain.\nVictims are bound with yomi-forged thorned iron chains and hang from the stalactites of a great cave for a unspecified period of time. Each time the victims struggles, the thorns will bite themselves deeper into their essence, feeding the [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')]."
 podgloss.yamaking: "Yama Kings, also known as Devil Kings, are powerful entities that reign over a [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')].\nIt is thought that they were once judges of the dead but have become corrupted over time and now use their position to elevate themselves above the others, hoping to become the Demon Emperor that will topple the Heavens.\nWhile they all have their different personalities and preferences, they all use [akuma|E] servants to further their aims in the mortal world."
 podgloss.dharma: "For the [kuei_jin|E], a Dharma is a path to enlightenment which allows them to transcend their bestial natures and holds out hope for enlightenment and rejoining the Karmic cycle. As demonic creatures, enlightenment is far harder for [kuei_jin|E], and the path to wisdom can take millennia.\nTraditionally, the Five Dharma outlined by the Grand Arhat Xue (Devil-Tiger, Song of the Shadow, Resplendent Crane, Bone Flowers and Thrashing Dragons) are considered the proper, orthodox, Dharma while all the others are heretical to some degree."
 podgloss.hundredclouds: "The Hundred Clouds are the ultimate goal of the [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')]. It means a shedding of one's karmic damnation and rejoining into the cycle of reincarnation.\n "The Hundred Clouds" is a metaphorical term for ultimate peace, the transcendent state in which even the duties of Heaven are set aside. The Clouds are not power, although lesser [kuei_jin|E] might see them that way; they are not illusions, though they might seem so to individuals who cannot understand them. By joining The Hundred Clouds (which the wise understand to be a symbol, not a group), a [kuei_jin|E] reaches the peak of its being, even higher than a [Glossary('Bodhisattva','podgloss.bodhisattva')]. Most leave this world behind after reaching such heights, vanishing to an unknown destination. Others chose to remain and guide others instead."
 podgloss.bodhisattva: "Bodhisattvas are [kuei_jin|E] that have reached the final stages of their chosen [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')].\nRelatively few [kuei_jin|E] ever attain the rank of bodhisattva; the process takes centuries, even millennia, and most [kuei_jin|E] meet Final Death or succumb to the inner demon long before they reach the bodhisattva stage. Those who do reach this stage are vastly powerful beings - easily on the level of a Western vampire Methuselah.\nThough a few stay politically active, most act as spiritual leaders instead."
 podgloss.arhat: "An Arhat is a [kuei_jin|E] who has transcended his [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')] and reached the [Glossary('Hundred Clouds','podgloss.hundredclouds')], freeing himself from the curse of unlife. Most had been hundreds of years old before they managed to transcend.\nThe most famous and well-remembered Arhat is Xue, who laid down the Fivefold Way that give birth to the Five Orthodox [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')]. To this day, many think that emulating Xue is still the only true way to reach Enlightenment."
 podgloss.wheelofages: "The Wheel of Ages is the eternal cycle of being, in which the earth suffers through the eras of increasing misery, until the nadir of the cycle is reached and the world begins to right itself toward Paradise once more.\nIt is divided by Ages, though the various supernaturals will have different interpretations of those. Most of them agree that the last Age before Paradise will be the ascent of a [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')] who will try to stop the Wheel and rule forever."
 podgloss.demonemperor: "In the eschatology of the [kuei_jin|E], the Sixth Age will be marked by the arrival of a supreme lord of darkness and horror who will rule over the world with an iron (and spiky) fist. This coming Demon Emperor will be the hallmark of that fallen age, and the only mercy in his time is that the Sixth Age will be brief...if the Universe is still running properly.\n\nGuessing who will be Demon Emperor is a popular sport for [kuei_jin|E]. The [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] generally assume that the Demon Emperor will be one of their number, with the most common candidate in 1230 being [Glossary('Emma-O','podgloss.emmao')]. Other common choices include Saulot, who seems to have encountered the mythology when traveling in the East and decided that ruling as Demon Emperor would be preferable to rapprochement with the Almighty."
 podgloss.penangallan: "Originating from a Malay term for vampires, Penangallan ended up as a catch all name for the [kuei_jin|E] matriarchs of South-East Asia. Followers of the Thrashing Dragons [Glossary('Dharma','podgloss.dharma')] and very much Yang unbalanced, these aggressively feminist [kuei_jin|E] are either fostering a complete liberation of the self or brutal and sadistic hellholes depending on who you ask."
 podgloss.emmao: "Emma-O, the dark lord of [Glossary('Kakuri','podgloss.kakuri')], is the current favorite in the great war of the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] for the seat of the [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')].\nThe epitome of the Yin Aspect, Emma-O is a calculated, thought out individual lacking mercy. Usually appearing as an exceedingly tall man, wearing a long beard and generally cultivating a hairy appearance, with skin of obsidian, dressed in Ainu cloth bearing designs of battle, disease and death. He is often accompanied by his beautiful [Glossary('Shikome','podgloss.shikome')] servants.\n\nEmma-O is the only currently active [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')] that can boast to have triumphed over one of his peers, him being the once Judge of Balance Yen-Lo."
 podgloss.kakuri: "Also known as the Night Realm, Kakuri is a [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')] controlled by the [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')] [Glossary('Emma-O','podgloss.emmao')].\nKakuri is a Yin-aspected domain, a lightless, joyless, honorless void of ice and snow.\nAs the ancestral death domain of the Ainu, Kakuri has a secret way out for [Glossary('Emma-O','podgloss.emmao')]'s original worshipers."
 podgloss.shikome: "Icily beautiful, the Shikome are the assassins, bodyguards and concubines of [Glossary('Emma-O','podgloss.emmao')]. Every shikome was hand-picked by [Glossary('Emma-O','podgloss.emmao')] himself and carefully lured into serving him. Many of them were abused, neglected or forgotten in their mortal years, and now happily serve their master in whom they have found the qualities of a father, lover and lord. He, in turn, shows them respect.\n\nA shikome's most dangerous ability is her skill at manipulating men. Shikome feed on the willpower of men the way most [kuei_jin|E] feed on Chi. While women automatically despise shikome and try to attack them, men will do anything for them, give them anything they desire and die for them in the hopes of a kind glance (which they will never get)."
 podgloss.mikaboshi: "Mikaboshi, lord of the [Glossary('Wicked City','podgloss.wickedcity')], is a [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')] that was once a Japanese scholar and architect. While very young compared to his peers, his drive for relentless innovation and the creation of a "machine state" that will turn humanity into soulless husks makes him a rising star as the civilizations of mankind expand more and more."
 podgloss.wickedcity: "The Wicked City is a [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')] controlled by the [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')] [Glossary('Mikaboshi','podgloss.mikaboshi')].\nIt is a nightmare of cyberpunk, demented Feng Shui and soulcrushing management theories.\nIt is a place where all the worst elements of greed and capitalism meet in Yomi's atmosphere of corruption. It is also one of the fastest growing [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')]."
 podgloss.anda: "The Anda are a [cainite|E] bloodline of the Gangrel who exist among the Mongols. They themselves believe they are scions of Itugen, the earth goddess of Mongolian religion.\nTheir regional proximity to the [kuei_jin|E] has often resulted in skirmishes though the mortal Mongol conquests threaten to make the situation much worse."
 podgloss.augustpersonageofjade: "In [kuei_jin|E] myth, the current, though inactive, ruler of Heaven and embodiment of Creation. When the Sixth Age arrives, the Personage will step down, to be replaced by the [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')]."
 podgloss.infantdevilcivilizer: "There is a when and where for a parent’s gentle persuasion, but during the taming of wild [kuei_jin|E] freshly returned from the [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')] is not such a time. Into this role steps the Infant Devil Civilizer, the supervisor of various local Infant Devil Civilizing Societies’ efforts to reclaim, subdue and escort these returned souls to the nearest Court."
 podgloss.wu: "The idea of natural mutual support among like-minded [kuei_jin|E] ordains the primary level of social interaction and definition within [kuei_jin|E] society. They organize themselves into groups of five (usually), traditionally called Wu. A Wu functions as a [kuei_jin|E]'s surrogate family during this second chance at existence."
 podgloss.toumu: "The [kuei_jin|E] have a formidable enemy in [UmbraGlossaryLocalized('yomi_wan','Yomi Hell')] more terrible than any other, and her name is Tou Mu.\nTou Mu is among the most malicious of the [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')], and it is this hatefulness that has brought her so near the throne of the [Glossary('Demon Emperor','podgloss.demonemperor')]. The Iron Empress is by far the best-known Yama Queen and is known for her passionate hatred for the Kindred of the East.\nWhile other [Glossary('Yama Kings','podgloss.yamaking')] will try to corrupt and ensnare them, working for the Iron Empress is a stay of execution at the very best."
 podgloss.wuhua: "Wu Hua, lord of the Pit of Salt and Iron, is a [Glossary('Yama King','podgloss.yamaking')]. While his Hell and overall power is smaller than some of his rivals, he is not lacking in wickedness.\nWorking his prisoners to the bone, Wu Hua only offers the Iron Brothels as a potential escape route that many end up regretting choosing.\nWu Hua's organizational structure has been styled after the bureaucratic structures of early China. Obedient servants are rewarded with gifts and promotion. Disobedient lackeys are punished and finally destroyed. Any creature who has moved up through these twisted ranks is undoubtedly a creature of great wickedness and cunning, and should be treated with caution."
