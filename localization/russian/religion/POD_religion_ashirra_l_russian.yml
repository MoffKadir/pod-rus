 tariqelsama: "Самск"
 tariqelsama_adj: "Тарик эль-Сама"
 tariqelsama_adherent: "эль-Сама"
 tariqelsama_adherent_plural: "эль-Сама"
 tariqelsama_desc: "A follower of the Tariq el-Sama clings to the revelations of the Prophet and counterbalances the raging of the Beast with nightly prayer and unshakeable faith. He does not resist the Beast when it stirs, but allows it a moderate release, reining it in when the urges threaten to take control entirely. The challenge is to keep the balance and allow them only in moderation, for evil lies in excess."

 tariqelumma_adherent: "Sadeeq"
 tariqelumma_adherent_plural: "Asdiqa"
 tariqelumma_desc: "Followers of the Tariq el-Umma are given to reaffirming their basic natures through acts of kindness and compassion. Often they seek to protect and help their mortal neighbors in secret, and intercede when possible to right injustices or see the guilty punished. Many adherents balance their bestial natures by contributing to the spread of knowledge and healing throughout the Islamic world."

Likewise he is to defend the honor of women and children. On the field of battle, he must fight like a man possessed, heedless of his own safety. It is not the warrior's life to lose, but Allah's."

 tariqelbedouin_adj: "Тарик эль-Бедуин"
 tariqelbedouin_adherent: "Tribesman"
 tariqelbedouin_adherent_plural: "Tribesmen"
 tariqelbedouin_desc: "A Muslim vampire follows this Tariq because he believes that the indolence and seductive luxuries of palaces and cities weakens an individual's self-discipline and moral courage. Rather than suffer the countless distractions of a nightly existence filled with myriad entertainments, the vampire seeks a harder, more desperate existence, emptying his mind of all save the moment-to-moment challenges posed by the wilderness."

They offer themselves to Allah's cause, hoping to be considered as worthy as the mortal martyrs of Islam."

Islam would live on — could only live on — in those who had personally witnessed the words of the Prophet and would always be around to relate it to others."

 tariqelatham_adherent_plural: "Scholars"
 tariqelatham_desc: "Mainly practiced by the Qabilat al-Mawt, this Tariq combines both the Road of Bones with the Ashirra beliefs. This has lead to more benign methods of seeking knowledge, such as  the astrological studies of the muslim world. Although not fully accepted by most Ashirra sects, the Tariq el-A'Tham is still tolerated and its adherents are free to pursue knowledge as long as it does not harm mortals."
